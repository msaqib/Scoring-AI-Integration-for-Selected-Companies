{"filename": "909494_2018.txt", "score": 0.67, "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the 10-K, I estimate the firm's exposure to GenAI as follows:\n\n1. Infer major occupational groups:\n   - Technical/IT roles (e.g. software developers, network administrators)\n   - Sales/customer service roles (e.g. resellers, customer support)\n   - Administrative roles (e.g. finance, HR)\n\n2. Map these to O*NET task categories:\n   - Technical/IT: Computer programming, network management, systems analysis\n   - Sales/customer service: Sales, customer service\n   - Administrative: Bookkeeping, data entry, general office tasks\n\n3. Estimate time savings for those tasks:\n   - Technical/IT: 0.5 (some tasks automated, but human oversight still needed)\n   - Sales/customer service: 0.5 (some customer interactions and sales processes automated)\n   - Administrative: 1.0 (many routine administrative tasks can be fully automated)\n\n4. Calculate a weighted firm-level exposure score:\n   - Assuming roughly equal distribution across the 3 groups, the weighted average exposure score is:\n     (0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.67\n\nFinal Exposure Score: 0.67\n\nThe firm's exposure to GenAI is moderately high, with significant potential for automation of administrative tasks and partial automation of technical/IT and sales/customer service functions. The firm will likely need to adapt its workforce and processes to leverage GenAI technologies while maintaining human oversight and customer relationships."}
{"filename": "912093_2018.txt", "score": 0.25, "reasoning": "Based on the 10-K, I would estimate the following regarding VIAVI's exposure to generative AI:\n\n1. Major Occupational Groups:\n   - Research & Development: Developing new products and technologies\n   - Manufacturing: Producing optical components and other hardware\n   - Sales & Marketing: Selling solutions to customers\n   - Service & Support: Enabling and supporting customers' networks\n\n2. Mapping to O*NET Task Categories:\n   - R&D: Creative Problem Solving, Technology Design, Research\n   - Manufacturing: Equipment Maintenance, Quality Control, Production\n   - Sales & Marketing: Sales, Customer Service, Marketing\n   - Service & Support: Troubleshooting, Operations Monitoring, Repairing\n\n3. Estimated Time Savings:\n   - R&D: 0.5 - Generative AI could assist with ideation, prototyping, and testing, but core R&D tasks still require human expertise.\n   - Manufacturing: 0.0 - Physical production tasks are not easily automatable with current AI capabilities.\n   - Sales & Marketing: 0.5 - AI-powered tools could streamline customer interactions, lead generation, and content creation.\n   - Service & Support: 0.5 - AI-based diagnostics and troubleshooting could improve efficiency, but human involvement is still crucial.\n\n4. Weighted Firm-level Exposure Score:\n   Assuming the following rough allocation of employees:\n   - R&D: 30%\n   - Manufacturing: 40% \n   - Sales & Marketing: 20%\n   - Service & Support: 10%\n\n   The weighted exposure score would be:\n   (0.3 * 0.5) + (0.4 * 0.0) + (0.2 * 0.5) + (0.1 * 0.5) = 0.25\n\nFinal Exposure Score: 0.25\n\nThe 10-K indicates that VIAVI operates in industries undergoing significant technological change, particularly around network infrastructure, virtualization, and automation. While generative AI could have an impact on certain tasks across the company's operations, the core R&D, manufacturing, and customer-facing activities are likely to still require substantial human expertise and involvement. Therefore, I estimate VIAVI's overall exposure to generative AI to be moderate, with a score of 0.25."}

{"filename": "943034_2018.txt", "score": 0.25, "reasoning": "Here is my analysis of the GenAI exposure for Image Sensing Systems, Inc. based on the information provided in the 10-K filing:\n\n1. Infer major occupational groups from the 10-K:\n   - Software developers and engineers (e.g. developing and enhancing video and radar processing algorithms)\n   - Sales and marketing personnel (e.g. managing distribution channels and direct sales)\n\n2. Map these groups to O*NET task categories:\n   - Software developers: Analyzing requirements, designing software, writing/testing code\n   - Sales/marketing: Selling products, managing customer relationships, marketing and advertising\n\n3. Estimate time savings for those tasks:\n   - Software development tasks: 0.5 (some automation but still requires significant human involvement)\n   - Sales/marketing tasks: 0.5 (some automation but still requires significant human involvement)\n\n4. Calculate a weighted firm-level exposure score:\n   - Software development tasks: 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25\n   - Sales/marketing tasks: 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25\n   - Weighted average exposure score: (0.25 + 0.25) / 2 = 0.25\n\nFinal Exposure Score: 0.25\n\nReasoning:\nThe 10-K highlights that Image Sensing Systems has developed a portfolio of proprietary software algorithms and applications over the past two decades that are central to its video and radar detection products. This suggests a significant software development and engineering component to the business. \n\nAt the same time, the company relies heavily on distribution channels and direct sales, indicating an important sales and marketing function. However, the 10-K does not indicate that these sales and marketing activities are heavily automated or augmented by GenAI at this time.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, I estimate a moderate GenAI exposure score of 0.25, reflecting some potential for automation in software development and sales/marketing tasks, but still a substantial need for human involvement across these key functions."}
