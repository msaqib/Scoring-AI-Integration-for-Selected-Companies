We provide a set of application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solutions with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce Platform API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our services on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. Administrators, developers and business users can also take advantage of our custom-branded tool sets with point-and-click ease to develop reusable components to tailor and extend the CRM experience with AI, IoT data and content."

We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remain focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2019 and beyond."
