Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, supply chain attacks, social engineering, open source vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,” security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. Additionally, some actors are using artificial intelligence technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, or breaches or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised."

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we started volume shipments of a new leading-edge UFS-based MCP (\"uMCP\") that uses our 1Z LPDRAM. This new UFS MCP enables flagship-like performance and densities to mid and high-end smartphones. Our LPDRAM solutions are engineered to meet the demanding performance and power specifications of industry-leading smartphone manufacturers."

        "text": "Enterprise and Cloud SSDs : SBU sales to the enterprise and cloud SSD markets in 2019 consisted primarily of our flagship SATA 5200 and 5100 series SSDs. In 2019, we continued offering our 5200 series SATA SSDs, which deliver best-in-class performance and capacity and achieved revenue crossover from our 5100 series SSDs. In 2019, we launched our 9300 Datacenter NVMe SSDs for enterprise and cloud markets. These 9300 NVMe SSDs feature industry-leading sequential write performance and latency, increased capacities, and nearly a 30% reduction in power consumption over the previous generation. Similar to trends in the memory market, the enterprise and cloud storage markets have been driven by intelligent edge devices capable of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and other features that store, access, and analyze data in the cloud. Artificial intelligence servers require significantly higher SSD capacity and our 64-layer QLC NAND technology provides cost-optimized storage solutions with significantly lower total cost of ownership for read-intensive cloud workloads. By leveraging our advanced CuA NAND in enterprise and cloud SSDs, we deliver low-cost, high-density, high-performance storage solutions."
