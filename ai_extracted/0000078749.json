Our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities due to a pandemic or other wide-ranging and sustained events. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new solutions, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance. Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements; Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices. Our product development activities are costly, and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. Our product development activities also could be impacted by competition from products with new features or new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that might render our existing products less competitive or obsolete. We may not respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services. Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may require us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects on our profitability. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity. Our future success depends on our ability to execute on strategic initiatives, to properly manage investments in our business, and to enhance our existing operations and infrastructure. Our long-term strategy is focused on continually investing in and growing our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions."

Also, implementation projects could take longer than planned or fail. We may not be able to reduce or eliminate protracted installation or significant additional costs. Significant delays or unsuccessful customer implementation projects could result in cancellation or renegotiation of existing agreements, claims from customers, harm to our reputation and negatively impact our operating results. We use open-source software in our solutions that may subject our solutions to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions. We use open-source software in our solutions and may use more open-source software in the future. From time to time, there have been accusations by companies claiming ownership of software that was previously thought to be open-source and that was incorporated by other companies into their products. As a result, we could be subject to legal claims by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software. Some open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open-source software and that we license these modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open-source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine or, in some cases, link our proprietary software solutions with or to open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions or license such proprietary solutions under the terms of a particular open-source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. In addition, open-source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open-source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open-source software, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to complex, evolving regulatory requirements that may be difficult and expensive to comply with and that could negatively impact our business. Our business and operations are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate or in which we offer our solutions, including, among other things, with respect to data privacy, artificial intelligence (“AI”), information security, trade compliance, tax, and labor matters. In addition, as we are increasingly building and licensing from third party providers new and evolving technologies, such as AI, machine learning, analytics, and biometrics, as part of our offerings, our business and operations may become subject to additional complex and evolving regulatory requirements pertaining to the sale or use of these technologies. The evolving regulatory environment surrounding these new technologies may also increase our research and development costs, compliance costs, and confidentiality and security risks, and result in inconsistencies in evolving legal frameworks across jurisdictions. The sale of these technologies, or their use by us or by our customers or partners, may also subject us to additional risks, including reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liabilities, due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social or discriminatory contexts. Third-parties may criticize us or seek to hold us responsible not only for our own activities in this regard but also for the activities of our customers or partners. We may become subject to regulation and disclosure requirements related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. In addition, stakeholders, including investors, customers, suppliers and employees, may pressure us to make commitments on these matters that may be difficult to manage or achieve. If we fail to make or meet such commitments, we may be subject to criticism, reputational harm or legal liability. The application of various laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements may be onerous, time-consuming, and expensive, especially where these requirements are inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or where the jurisdictional reach of certain requirements is not clearly defined or seeks to reach across national borders. Regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may make it difficult or impossible to do business in or comply with the rules of another jurisdiction."

Violations of these laws or regulations may harm our reputation and deter government agencies and other existing or potential customers or partners from purchasing our solutions. Furthermore, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, restrictions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Cyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to collect, process, transmit, and store electronic information on behalf of our customers. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, procurement, invoicing, and email communications. These systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, hacking, terrorist attacks, and similar events. We have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers. In addition, threat actors are also increasingly using tools and techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that we and others may be unable to anticipate, detect, deflect, contain or recover from cyberattacks in a timely or effective manner. As AI capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see cyberattacks created through AI. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effective phishing emails. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. The number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers, and ultimately, our business. For example, we use Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer application to enable file transfers with some of our customers. On May 31, 2023, Progress Software disclosed that it had identified a previously unknown vulnerability in its MOVEit Transfer application. We immediately followed the recommendations from Progress Software to address the vulnerabilities in the MOVEit Transfer application. However, we identified unauthorized file downloads from our MOVEit Transfer application impacting about 130 customers who used our InfoGenesis POS, Eatec and Agilysys Analyze products. All impacted customers were notified in June 2023, and the incident has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation. Cyberattacks on our systems and “supply-chain” attacks on systems of third parties upon whom we rely, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations."
