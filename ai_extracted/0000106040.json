This growth has led to the creation of new form factors for data storage. The storage industry is increasingly utilizing tiered architectures with solid state drives (“SSD”), HDD and other non-volatile memory-based storage to address an expanding set of uses and applications. We believe our expertise and innovation across both HDD and Flash technologies enable us to bring powerful solutions to a broad range of applications. We continuously monitor the full array of storage technologies, including reviewing these technologies with our customers, to ensure we are appropriately resourced to meet our customers’ storage needs."

The demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period. Demand for and prices of our products are influenced by, among other factors, the actual and projected growth of data to be stored, the balance between supply and demand in the storage market, including the effects of new fab capacity, macroeconomic factors, business conditions, the emergence or growth of new or existing technologies (including AI), technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors. The storage market has recently experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of excess capacity leading to liquidation of excess inventories, inventory write-downs, significant reductions in ASPs and negative impacts on our revenue and gross margins and volatile product life cycles that harm our ability to recover the cost of product development."

These incidents have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, disruption to parts of our business operations and result in various investigation, recovery and remediation expenses. In addition, the technology infrastructure and information systems of some of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such incidents. Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including the covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, and the use of techniques or processes that change frequently, may be disguised or difficult to detect, or are designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, and may continue undetected for an extended period of time. Cybersecurity incidents have in the past resulted from, and may in the future result from, social engineering or impersonation of authorized users, and may also result from efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage. In some instances, efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent incidents have in the past, and may in the future, reduce the functionality or performance of our information systems and networks, which could negatively impact our business. We believe malicious cybersecurity acts are increasing in number and that cybersecurity threat actors are increasingly organized and well-financed or supported by state actors and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only infiltrate information systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities. Additionally, as AI capabilities continue to evolve and become more readily available, we may face increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that leverage AI technologies. These may include highly convincing phishing or social engineering attacks that use AI-generated deepfakes, the exploitation of vulnerabilities in electronic identity validation security programs via AI-replicated images or voices, or the inadvertent incorporation of malicious or hallucinated content generated by AI tools into our systems or those of our customers or partners.

Our possession and use of data, including personal data and employee data in conducting our business, subjects us to legal and regulatory obligations that require us to notify vendors, customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings. Managing these notifications, especially in large volumes, can lead to significant expenses, even with cybersecurity insurance coverage. Laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, security and privacy of data change over time and new laws and regulations become effective from time to time. We are subject to notice and privacy statement requirements, as well as obligations to respond to data subject requests. Global privacy and data protection legislation, enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving, including with respect to the use of AI, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We may also be subject to restrictions on cross-border data transfers and requirements for localized storage of data that could increase our compliance costs and risks and affect the ability of our global operations to coordinate activities and respond to customers and individuals. Our use of AI technology may create new privacy and security risks, especially where personal data is involved. The use of AI may raise ethical concerns, lead to flawed outcomes, or present other privacy and security risks that could make it more difficult to adopt or implement effectively.

However, macroeconomic factors such as tariffs, inflation, changes in interest rates, and recession concerns can affect demand for our products. As an example, in fiscal 2024, we and our industry experienced a supply-demand imbalance, which led to reduced shipments, negatively impacted pricing, and resulted in business realignment charges and charges for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to the underutilization of facilities as we temporarily scaled back production and took other actions to align our operations to the market at the time."
