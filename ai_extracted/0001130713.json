        "text": "Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees. Changes in the roles and responsibilities of members of management or the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could harm our business. Members of senior management or key employees may need to take a leave of absence for medical or other reasons. In 2013 our Chief Executive Officer and then Chairman of the Board, Dr. Patrick Byrne, took a two-month leave of absence for medical reasons, and in 2016 he took a three-month leave of absence for medical reasons. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel and we do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance policies. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly-skilled technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, marketing and customer service personnel. For example, the platform and trading system that may be developed by tZERO, including the technology and intellectual property that may be developed in connection with the project, is expected to be developed primarily by a small number of key employees of tZERO and its affiliates. Competition for such personnel, particularly technical personnel including high-end data engineers, experts in rapidly developing fields including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and other technical experts, is intense. Our failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. In addition, certain changes in our relationship with Dr. Patrick Byrne could result in a default under and/or early mandatory pre-payment obligation of our $40 million loan. See \"-The terms of our term loan agreement include unusual repayment and default triggers\" above."
