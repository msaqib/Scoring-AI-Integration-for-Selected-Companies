Our mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which we believe will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. Innodata was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, we believe that we’re delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. We believe that we can contribute meaningfully by harnessing our capabilities, honed over 35 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. We’re also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that our customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. Market Opportunities AI Data Preparation AI applications are trained with large quantities of data, unlike traditional computer applications that use languages such as Python and Java to tell computers what to do. AI applications learn from the data through a series of regressions. Today’s highest performing AI applications (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT) would never have been possible to build through traditional programming. Data science teams at some of the largest technology companies are accelerating development of generative AI technologies that produce high quality text, code, and images in response to user prompts. At their core, they rely upon large language models (LLMs), which are deep neural networks (an artificial intelligence architecture) with billions of parameters and requiring massive amounts of training data to encode the essence of human language. They require fine-tuning through supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to render them suitable for specialized tasks and domains, to control hallucinations (the tendency of these models to make up things on the fly), and to minimize the risk that they generate unsafe or biased results. In addition, companies across industry verticals are seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants, chatbots, content moderation, robotics, fraud detection and contract review. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 1 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 2020) ​ 4"

As AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical and data preparation becomes increasingly complex, data science teams seek partners with deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to partner with data science teams. In 2024, we expanded existing relationships and forged new relationships with several of the world’s large technology companies to support their efforts at building generative AI foundation models. For these companies, we are now providing or are poised to provide a range of scaled data solutions and services. Our scaled data solutions include providing instruction data sets for fine-tuning LLMs to understand prompts, to accept instruction, to converse, to apparently reason, and to perform the myriad of incredible feats that many of us have now experienced. We also provide reinforcement learning and reward modeling, services which are critical to provide the guardrails against toxic, bias and harmful responses, and model evaluation services. For social media companies, financial services companies, and many others, we collect or create training data, annotate training data, and train AI algorithms for working with images, text, video, audio, code and sensor data. We utilize a variety of leading third-party tools, proprietary tools and customer tools. For text annotation, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. Our platform encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 35-year history of creating high-quality data. In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or rarity of cohorts and outliers), we create high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage LLMs. We are presently working with five of the largest technology companies, and several of the world’s leading brands spanning multiple verticals, to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to end users around generative AI foundation models and other AI that supports chatbot assistance, facial recognition, social networking, podcasts, legal research and medical diagnostics, to name a few.

Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have built over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past nine years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below. ) Our 6,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Global Delivery Framework”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Global Delivery Framework We have over 6,000 employees and associates across 31 countries. Many of them have data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology and hold advanced degrees. We also have access to a large population of remote staff and freelancers that we maintain in our databases. Our delivery locations are strategically located to give us access to a diverse talent base spanning multiple time zones and more than 40 languages. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently approximately 75% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. Our Technology Over the past nine years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, orchestration and cognitive processing, and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our workbenches incorporate data verification and validation algorithms to detect human expert inconsistencies and to catch difficult auto-annotation errors such as LLM hallucinations. 7"

        "text": "The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have built over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past nine years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below. ) Our 6,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Global Delivery Framework”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality.

Goldengate ingests unstructured data and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up low-code AI with transfer learning, orchestrating generative LLMs and deep learning-based sequence labeling models we have developed over the past nine years of deploying industrial deep neural networks as well as third-party foundation models. It integrates both with our internal systems and customer environments through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Today, Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for certain of the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation, document intelligence and regulatory change management platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it is “low-code”, so it does not require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global customers on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. In January 2023, we released a module within our Agility product called PR CoPilot™ that augments the work communications professionals do to generate press releases and media outreach. It leverages proprietary Innodata technology and OpenAI’s GPT large language models. We believe PR CoPilot is the first AI writing assistant built natively into a fully-integrated PR platform. To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, and pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”), and Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of information technology resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2024, our Wide Area Network had 99.90% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention services.

For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without access to sophisticated data sciences support, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacks an application to analyze and manage the data, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Legacy We developed our capabilities and honed our approaches progressively over the last 35 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately nine years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. Our historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of our offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. Our Culture We have developed a strong customer- and quality-centric culture over 35 years serving many of the world’s most successful companies that trust us with their data needs. We believe in communicating honestly, transparently and broadly. We are optimistic in the promise of technology to augmenting human initiative and talent. We embrace diversity and prize empathy and respect in our relationships with customers and colleagues alike, while at the same time, honing direct communication that best promotes optimal business outcomes for our customers. We believe our culture helps us best serve our customers and helps us attract and retain top people. Growth Strategy We believe that we are living in a unique time – that AI will soon become the “brains” of our computers, our robots and our cars; and that AI will be adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding. In AI, the software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data. Nowhere does the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” apply better. A data-centric approach for collection and annotation of consistent, high-quality data will separate the winners from the losers. Our strategy for growth is to leverage our 35+ year experience creating high quality data. We intend to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the creation and commercialization of increasingly sophisticated AI and deployment of AI in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 35 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past nine years. 9"

We intend to pursue new long-term, strategic customer relationships, especially with customers with large and growing commitments to AI innovation, where we can deliver a wide range of our capabilities and have meaningful impact. We are focused on hiring and retaining sales talent and in building a data-driven sales organization. We believe that the current sales organization is operating well and will likely enable us to achieve our near-term growth targets. Expanding Relationships with Existing Customers We believe we have demonstrated a clear ability to “land-and-expand” within customer accounts. Once we engage with a customer within a specific line of business and specific use cases, and the customer experiences the benefits of working with us, it will often increase the number of use cases for which it engages us and expand to additional lines of business. Continuing to Develop New Capabilities We intend to develop new capabilities designed around emerging customer needs and advances in AI technologies. We intend to develop additional charter customer relationships, like the ongoing relationship we formed with one of the world’s largest banks to co-develop an AI-enabled compliance platform. Continuing to Innovate We believe that our ability to innovate will continue to be an important contributor to our growth and market traction. We work closely with our customers, assessing their requirements for enhancements to our existing capabilities and new capabilities with the goal of better serving them.

We expect to fund these investments for growth from our internal resources and we may access capital through debt or equity financing. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 48% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Another customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 10% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing customers. In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations.

In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing customers. In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads.

Our product engineering teams also engage in research and development efforts focused on enhancing the functionality and utility of our AI industry platforms, addressing new use cases and developing additional innovative technologies. Timely development of new functionality to support existing and new use cases is essential to maintaining our competitive position, and we release new versions of our software on a regular basis. Customer feedback enables us to ensure that we stay aligned to our customers’ priorities and that we stay ahead of market needs. Our culture of innovation helps us attract and retain a highly motivated and talented team of AI experts and technologists. Our research and development center spans several geographical locations across North America and Asia-Pacific. In mid-2022, we formed an Advisory Board dedicated to helping drive growth through innovation initiatives and advancing dialogue related to ethical AI and the future of AI technologies. A Chief Data Officer for Microsoft currently serves as our only Advisory Board member. We will likely consider adding additional members to our advisory board from time to time. Environmental, Social, and Governance We have built a robust corporate ESG program focused on social responsibility; improving how we perform as a steward of the environment; and sustainability. Social Responsibility We are inspired by the vision of fostering a future of broadly distributed, sustainable prosperity that can result from ethical AI and broad access to the benefits of AI. We launched our i-Hope Program in 2016 to help children in marginalized or economically disadvantaged communities face the challenges of an increasingly AI-driven world. Our goal of delivering the gift of computer literacy to 25,000 children by 2025 was achieved ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2023. As a part of this initiative, one of our operating subsidiaries handed over a smart classroom, an ideation room, and an open library (with over 80,000 books) to a publicly-funded higher education institution in the Philippines. Since 2016 we have contributed over 3,700 person-days to this and other Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs. We have built and made operational 24 fully functional computer labs and smart classrooms across India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. As a result, approximately 42,500 children have become more technology-proficient and better equipped to seize opportunities in the AI era. Our contributions have been well-recognized. Examples of award recognition received in 2024 through our operating subsidiaries include: for the fourth time, the Circle of Excellence Award for CSR Company of the Year at the Asia CEO Awards-2024; the Best Environmental Responsibility Initiative; Innovation in CSR Practices; Women Empowerment Initiative from National CSR Leadership Congress & Awards; and Sustainable Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion award from the World Sustainability Congress.

Even though we have implemented network security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or intentional and unintentional disclosure of sensitive and /or confidential personal information by employees and non-employees. Additionally, the Company may not be able to effectively identify and resolve such issues on a timely basis. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The international nature of our operations subjects us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth. We do business on an international level, with a major portion of our operations carried on in India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, in addition to our operations in Canada, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while our headquarters are in the United States and our customers are primarily located in North America and Europe. While we do not depend on significant revenues from sources internal to the Asian countries in which we operate, we are nevertheless subject to certain adverse economic factors relating to overseas economies generally, including inflation, external debt, a negative balance of trade and underemployment. In certain of the countries in which we operate, tax authorities have exercised, and may continue to exercise, significant discretionary and arbitrary powers to make tax demands or decline to refund payments that may be due to us as per tax returns. Other risks associated with our international operations and business activities include: ● difficulties in staffing international projects and managing international operations, including overcoming logistical and communications challenges; ● local competition, particularly in the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka; ● imposition of public sector controls; ● trade and tariff restrictions; ● price or exchange controls; ● currency control regulations; ● foreign tax consequences; ● data privacy laws and regulations; ● evolving regulation of artificial intelligence; ● intellectual property laws and enforcement practices;"

Innodata Inc., et al., in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its current and former officers (the “Securities Class Action”). In October 2024, the presiding judge in the Securities Class Action appointed a lead plaintiff and approved the lead plaintiff’s choice of counsel. In January 2025, an amended Securities Class Action complaint was filed in the Securities Class Action. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and it alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology and services. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously, but the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Subsequently, in March 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff of the SEC, Division of Enforcement, requesting the Company preserve certain documents and data; in August 2024 the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) requesting the Company to produce certain documents; and in September 2024 the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting certain information. The Company believes that the SEC and DOJ requests are related to the conduct alleged in the Securities Class Action, and is cooperating with these investigations. The Company is unable to predict when these matters will be resolved or what further action, if any, the SEC or DOJ may take in connection with it. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for the losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above-referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the putative class action or other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, our estimate of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above-referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. See “Legal Proceedings”. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, any incident in which we fail to protect our customer’s information against security breaches may result in monetary damages against us, and termination of our engagement by our customer, and may adversely impact our results of operations. Certain laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security affecting our customers impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by these customers, as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. In addition, as part of the services we perform, we have access to confidential customer data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information. We may also be bound by certain customer agreements to use and disclose confidential customer information in a manner consistent with the privacy standards under regulations applicable to such customers. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management’s time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. 25"

(NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. Our mission is to deliver the promise of AI to the world’s most prestigious companies. We provide AI-enabled software platforms and managed services to companies that require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We also provide AI digital transformation solutions and platforms to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry business processes, we provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services. Our platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, our proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies we have developed. In addition, we bring to bear more than 4,500 employees spanning eight countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately six years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. We anticipate this strategy will enable us to accelerate growth. Market Opportunities AI Data Annotation Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots, content moderation, robotics and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition. Unlike traditional computer applications that are programmed in languages like Python and Java to tell computers what to do, AI applications can be created with little to no programming. Instead, AI applications are trained with large quantities of input data and expected output data. Leveraging such data, the AI application learns on its own from the data itself through a series of regressions. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 We train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner. We utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In November 2021 we announced the general availability of our text annotation platform for customer use which we anticipate will be a source of competitive differentiation and SaaS licensing revenue. The AI data training market is expected to grow to $3.5 billion by the end of 2024, 2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI system spending overall ($85.3 billion in 2021, $204 billion in 2025, a 24.5% CAGR). 3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $695 million in 2019, projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2027, which is a CAGR of 33%. 4 1 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) 2 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) 3 Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide, IDC (Aug. 30, 2021) 4 Data Annotation Tools Market to 2027 - Global Analysis and Forecasts by Type; Annotation Type; End-user , ReportLinker , (Mar. 2020) 4"

For industry-specific, document-intensive industry business processes, we provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services. Our platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, our proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies we have developed. In addition, we bring to bear more than 4,500 employees spanning eight countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately six years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. We anticipate this strategy will enable us to accelerate growth. Market Opportunities AI Data Annotation Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots, content moderation, robotics and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition. Unlike traditional computer applications that are programmed in languages like Python and Java to tell computers what to do, AI applications can be created with little to no programming. Instead, AI applications are trained with large quantities of input data and expected output data. Leveraging such data, the AI application learns on its own from the data itself through a series of regressions. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 We train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner. We utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In November 2021 we announced the general availability of our text annotation platform for customer use which we anticipate will be a source of competitive differentiation and SaaS licensing revenue. The AI data training market is expected to grow to $3.5 billion by the end of 2024, 2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI system spending overall ($85.3 billion in 2021, $204 billion in 2025, a 24.5% CAGR). 3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $695 million in 2019, projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2027, which is a CAGR of 33%. 4 1 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) 2 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) 3 Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide, IDC (Aug. 30, 2021) 4 Data Annotation Tools Market to 2027 - Global Analysis and Forecasts by Type; Annotation Type; End-user , ReportLinker , (Mar. 2020)"

For the past six years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below .) Our 4,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Domain Experts”, below .) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Domain Experts We have over 4,000 employees with deep data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology. Many of them hold advanced degrees. They process data in over 25 languages. For annotating complex or sensitive data, our expert staff provides an attractive alternative to the crowdsourced labor pools utilized by many of our competitors typically for mundane tasks. They are especially well-suited for high-context data, such as legal contract classification, medical images, medical records, and scientific and legal literature. Our Technology Over the past five years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, deep learning (a branch of AI), and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate accepts a wide range of documents – including images, PDFs, and web copy – and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up no-code AI with transfer learning built on generative language models we have developed over the past six years of deploying industrial deep neural networks. Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it’s “no-code”, so it doesn’t require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we intend to commercialize it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions. Goldengate functionality can be consumed as domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. Each AI microservice may be invoked by the dataflow via a RESTful API. Many complex data problems can be solved with a combination of these microservices. Capabilities include deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score. A confidence score at or above an established accuracy threshold means no human expert review is required. A confidence score below an established accuracy threshold means human expert review is required. When expert review is required, the dataflow automatically routes data to an appropriate human expert. Our human experts use workbenches that enable them to quickly and efficiently review the data and make judgements. The workbenches then retroactively feed 6"

To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global customers on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2021, our Wide Area Network had 99.96% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. ( See “Information Security”, below. ) Our Breath of Capabilities We are able to address customers at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without a sophisticated data sciences team, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacked such an application, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Outcomes Orientation We have developed a strong customer-centric culture and a set of values designed around achieving promised outcomes for our customers. This includes proactive communication, innovation, transparency, and empathy. Growth Strategy Our strategy for growth is to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the deployment of AI/ML in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past six years. We intend to invest significantly in scaling our sales and marketing. In 2021 we expanded our sales force by close to 400%, ending 2021 with a sales team of 115. We expect this will deliver significant returns in future years. 7"

We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently near 100% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. We expect to fully fund these investments for growth from our internal resources without need for outside financing. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 45% and 54%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and we have provided services to the customer referenced in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify customer relationships. Many of our customers are recurring customers, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our agreements with our customers are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our customers is subject to their requirements. Sales and Marketing We market and sell our solutions and platforms directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe. In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing customers. In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers. Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, virtual summits, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites). 8"

The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction. Environmental, Social, and Governance We are values-driven company, committed to continuously improving how we perform as a steward of nature, manage relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and communities, and conduct our business. While we are driven by the vision of ushering in the promise of digital data and ubiquitous AI, we are cognizant that the disruption AI will inevitably cause will not be equitably distributed. Ironically, many of the communities in which we source human capital for AI projects – communities in India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka – are also more heavily dependent on manual labor and face greater potential disruption as a result of AI. Therefore, as we set out on our AI journey six years ago, we made a concomitant commitment to do our part to help economically disadvantaged youth (especially young women) in these communities become technology-savvy. It was our aspiration that they become empowered beneficiaries of an AI-enabled world rather than its victims. From 2016 to 2021, our employees have contributed over 1,600 person days to our I-Hope program. I-Hope has built 14 fully-functional computer labs at schools across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and has donated over 110,000 books and other educational materials to schools and a public library. We believe these efforts stand to benefit approximately 70,000 students, teachers and the members of the general public. As a direct result of our work, we believe approximately 5,700 more children are now technology proficient and ready to take on challenges of navigating an increasingly AI-enabled world. In 2021, we were the proud recipients of the Corporate Excellence Awards in CSR Programs and Health, Safety, and Environment Programs 2020-2021 issued by Cebu IT-BTM Organization (CIB.O), and the DSWD Philippines (Department of Social Welfare & Development) Regional Citation Award. Our goal is to technology-enable 24,000 children by 2025, and we will be devoting a portion of our revenue to this worthy goal. Employees As of December 31, 2021, we employed 225 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 4,706 persons in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel, and we had 4,878 full-time employees. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in specialized fields such as law, business, technology, medicine, and social sciences.

        "text": "Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business and Operations We have historically relied on a limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of these significant clients . We have historically relied on a limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from non-U.S. clients accounted for 45% and 54%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. We may lose one or more of these clients, or our other major clients, as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our client’s requirements, the completion or termination of a project or engagement, or the client’s selection of another service provider. In addition, the volume of work performed for our major clients may vary from year to year, and services they require from us may change from year to year. They may also request that we modify certain key terms of our agreements with them as a condition of continuing to do business with us. If the volume of work performed for our major clients varies, if the services they require from us change, or if they require price concessions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may incur a loss from operations. If certain key terms of our agreements with our major clients are modified, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our services are typically subject to client requirements, and in many cases are terminable upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. The loss of these clients or a significant variation in the volume of work performed for these clients may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our services is provided on a non-recurring basis for specific projects, and our inability to replace large projects when they are completed or otherwise terminated has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenues and results of operations. We provide a portion of our services for specific projects that generate revenues that terminate on completion of a defined task. While we seek, whenever possible, on completion or termination of large projects, to counterbalance periodic declines in revenues with new arrangements to provide services to the same client or others, our inability to obtain sufficient new projects to counterbalance any decreases in such work may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. New acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments or partnerships could harm our operating results. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or engage in strategic investments or partnerships to grow and enhance our capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate any acquisitions or joint ventures, or realize profit from strategic investments, or achieve desired financial and operating results. Further, such activities involve a number of risks and challenges, including proper evaluation, diversion of management’s attention and proper integration with our current business. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any such venture we undertake. If we are unable to complete the kind of acquisitions for which we plan, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. Our new clients may sunset their products because of lack of sufficient revenues or declining revenues, and this may result in termination of our work for these clients. As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our clients may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them, or our clients may experience declining revenues with their existing products. This could be due to various reasons beyond our or their control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan or anticipated results could impact our margins and earnings. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions and enhance our existing services, platforms and solutions, and market acceptance of these offerings and our ability to compete with new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. The information technology and artificial intelligence (AI) industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to successfully develop services, platforms and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, and the acceptance of these services, platforms and solutions by our existing and target clients.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies Description of Business - Innodata Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. The Company’s mission is to deliver the promise of AI to the world’s most prestigious companies. The Company provides AI-enabled software platforms and managed services to companies that require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The Company also provides AI digital transformation solutions and platforms to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry business processes, the Company provides AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services. The Company’s platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, its proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies it has developed. In addition, the Company brings to bear more than 4,500 employees spanning eight countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. The Company’s hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables the Company to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. The Company developed its capabilities and honed its customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately six years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. The Company anticipates this strategy will enable it to accelerate growth. AI Data Annotation The Company trains AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. The Company utilizes a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, the Company uses its proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data. AI Digital Transformation The Company also provides AI solutions and platforms to companies that intensively process textual data and seek to obtain the benefits of AI/ML technologies without having to develop AI/ML engineering capabilities in-house. For such companies, the Company often integrates one or more of its pre-trained text processing algorithms as a foundation for an overall solution. The Company’s algorithms are accessible as microservices via application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling easy integration. In conjunction with AI digital transformation, the Company often provides a range of data engineering support services, including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. The Company’s customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns of the Company’s AI digital transformation solutions and platforms. Industry AI Platforms The Company’s industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that the Company believes it can fulfill in large part with its AI/ML technologies. The Company deploys these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”).

Innodata was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, we believe that we’re delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. We believe that we can contribute meaningfully by harnessing our capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy.

Data science teams at some of the largest technology companies are accelerating development of generative AI technologies that produce high quality text, code, and images in response to user prompts. At their core, they rely upon large language models (LLMs), which are deep neural networks (an artificial intelligence architecture) with billions of parameters and requiring massive amounts of training data to encode the essence of human language. They require fine-tuning through supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to render them suitable for specialized tasks and domains, to control hallucinations (the tendency of these models to make up things on the fly), and to minimize the risk that they generate unsafe or biased results. In addition, companies across industry verticals are seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants, chatbots, content moderation, robotics, fraud detection and contract review.

As AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical and data preparation becomes increasingly complex, data science teams seek partners with deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to partner with data science teams. In 2023, we expanded existing relationships and forged new relationships with several of the world’s large technology companies to support their efforts at building generative AI foundation models. For these companies, we are now providing or are poised to provide a range of scaled data solutions and services. Our scaled data solutions include providing instruction data sets for fine-tuning LLMs to understand prompts, to accept instruction, to converse, to apparently reason, and to perform the myriad of incredible feats that many of us have now experienced. We also provide reinforcement learning and reward modeling, services which are critical to provide the guardrails against toxic, bias and harmful responses, and model evaluation services. For social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, we collect or create training data, annotate training data, and train AI algorithms for working with images, text, video, audio, code and sensor data. We utilize a variety of leading third-party tools, proprietary tools and customer tools. For text annotation, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. Our platform encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or rarity of cohorts and outliers), we create high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage LLMs. We are presently working with five of the largest technology companies, and several of the world’s leading brands spanning multiple verticals, to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to end users around generative AI foundation models and other AI that supports chatbot assistance, facial recognition, social networking, gaming, drones, medical diagnostics and robotics, to name a few. ​ The AI data training market is estimated to be $2.57 billion in 2024, projected to grow at a CAGR of 18% to reach $13.45 billion by 2034, 2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI system spending overall ($154 billion in 2023, $300 billion in 2026, a 27% CAGR). 3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $1.8 billion in 2022, projected to reach $25 billion by 2032, which is a CAGR of 25%. 4 ​ AI Model Deployment and Integration We believe that over the next decade, almost all industries will be fundamentally reinvented through the advent of high-performing AI models.

Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have built over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past eight years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below. ) Our 4,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Global Delivery Framework”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Global Delivery Framework We have over 4,000 employees and associates across 31 countries. Many of them have data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology and hold advanced degrees. We also have access to a large population of remote staff and freelancers that we maintain in our databases. Our delivery locations are strategically located to give us access to a diverse talent base spanning multiple time zones and more than 40 languages. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently approximately 75% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. Our Technology Over the past eight years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, orchestration and cognitive processing, and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our workbenches incorporate data verification and validation algorithms to detect human expert inconsistencies and to catch difficult auto-annotation errors such as LLM hallucinations. 7"

Goldengate ingests unstructured data and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up low-code AI with transfer learning, orchestrating generative LLMs and deep learning-based sequence labeling models we have developed over the past eight years of deploying industrial deep neural networks as well as third-party foundation models. It integrates both with our internal systems and customer environments through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it is “low-code”, so it does not require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we commercialized it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions. To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global customers on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. In January 2023, we released a module within our Agility product called PR CoPilot™ that augments the work communications professionals do to generate press releases and media outreach. It leverages proprietary Innodata technology and OpenAI’s GPT large language models. We believe PR CoPilot is the first AI writing assistant built natively into a fully-integrated PR platform. To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, and pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”), and Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of information technology resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2023, our Wide Area Network had 99.98% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services.

For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without access to sophisticated data sciences support, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacks an application to analyze and manage the data, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Legacy We developed our capabilities and honed our approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately eight years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. Our historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of our offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. Our Culture We have developed a strong customer- and quality-centric culture over 30 years serving many of the world’s most successful companies that trust us with their data needs. We believe in communicating honestly, transparently and broadly. We are optimistic in the promise of technology to augmenting human initiative and talent. We embrace diversity (and began doing so long before it was in vogue). We prize empathy and respect in our relationships with customers and colleagues alike while at the same time honing direct communication that best promotes optimal business outcomes for our customers. We believe our culture helps us best serve our customers and helps us attract and retain top people. Growth Strategy We believe that we are living in a unique time – that AI will soon become the “brains” of our computers, our robots and our cars; and that AI will be adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding. In AI, the software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data. Nowhere does the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” apply better. A data-centric approach for collection and annotation of consistent, high-quality data will separate the winners from the losers. Our strategy for growth is to leverage our 30+ year experience creating high quality data. We intend to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the creation and commercialization of increasingly sophisticated AI and deployment of AI in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past eight years. 9"

We intend to pursue new long-term, strategic customer relationships, especially with customers with large and growing commitments to AI innovation, where we can deliver a wide range of our capabilities and have meaningful impact. Beginning in 2021, we substantially scaled our sales organization, most notably the sales organization supporting our Agility PR solutions product. In late 2021 and early 2022, we experienced challenges in retaining sales hires primarily in our Austin, Texas sales office. We have since closed that sales office, have focused on hiring and retaining sales talent in other locations and in building a data-driven sales organization. We believe that the current sales organization is operating well and will likely enable us to achieve our near-term growth targets. Expanding Relationships with Existing Customers We believe we have demonstrated a clear ability to “land-and-expand” within customer accounts. Once we engage with a customer within a specific line of business and specific use cases, and the customer experiences the benefits of working with us, it will often increase the number of use cases for which it engages us and expand to additional lines of business. Continuing to Develop New Capabilities We intend to develop new capabilities designed around emerging customer needs and advances in AI technologies. We intend to develop additional charter customer relationships, like the ongoing relationship we formed with one of the world’s largest banks to co-develop an AI-enabled compliance platform. Continuing to Innovate We believe that our ability to innovate will continue to be an important contributor to our growth and market traction. We work closely with our customers, assessing their requirements for enhancements to our existing capabilities and new capabilities with the goal of better serving them. We have well-defined roadmaps for our AI industry platforms to introduce new features and functions that we believe will enable us to generate growth by broadening the appeal of our platforms to potential new customers as well as increasing the opportunities for further expansions with existing customers. We expect to fund these investments for growth from our internal resources and we may access capital through debt or equity financing. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 10% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Another customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 37% and 38%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify customer relationships. Many of our customers are recurring customers, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our agreements with our customers are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our customers is subject to their requirements. 10"

In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads.

Customer feedback enables us to ensure that we stay aligned to our customers’ priorities and that we stay ahead of market needs. Our culture of innovation helps us attract and retain a highly motivated and talented team of AI experts and technologists. Our research and development center spans several geographical locations across North America and Asia-Pacific. In mid-2022, we formed an Advisory Board dedicated to helping drive growth through innovation initiatives and advancing dialogue related to ethical AI and the future of AI technologies. The advisory board is currently comprised by a Chief Data Officer for Microsoft and the director of University of Michigan’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. We will likely consider adding additional members to our advisory board from time to time. Environmental, Social, and Governance We have built a robust corporate ESG program focused on social responsibility; improving how we perform as a steward of the environment; and sustainability. Social Responsibility We are driven by the vision of ushering in an era of broadly distributed, sustainable prosperity that can result from ethical AI and broad access to the benefits of AI. We launched our i-Hope Program in 2016 to help children in marginalized or economically-disadvantaged communities face the challenges of an increasingly AI-driven world. Our goal was to provide the gift of computer literacy to 25,000 children by 2025. We are proud to report that we attained our goal in the third quarter of 2023, with one of our operating subsidiaries handing over a smart classroom, an ideation room, and an open library (with over 80,000 books) to a publicly-funded higher education institution in the Philippines. From 2016 to 2023, our employees contributed over 2,900 person days to the program, building 22 fully-functional computer labs and smart classrooms across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. As a result of i-Hope, we believe approximately 40,400 children in these communities are now more technology proficient and better prepared to participate in opportunities that AI presents. Our contributions have been well-recognized. In 2023 we (through our operating subsidiaries) received, for the third time in four years, the Circle of Excellence Award for CSR Company of the Year at the Asia CEO Awards-2023.

As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our customers may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them. Our customers may experience declining revenues with their existing products or may change their business direction. This could be due to various reasons beyond our or their control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan or anticipated results could impact our margins and earnings. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions and enhance our existing services, platforms and solutions, and market acceptance of these offerings. Our success is also dependent on our ability to compete with new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. The information technology and artificial intelligence (AI) industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to successfully develop services, platforms and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, and the acceptance of these services, platforms and solutions by our existing and target customers. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, platforms and solutions, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services, platforms and solutions are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services, platforms and solutions non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets. While we invest in developing and pursuing new services, platforms and solutions, our profitability could be reduced if these services, platforms and solutions do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new offerings do not generate the planned revenues. The markets for our services, platforms and solutions are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective customers who may attempt to duplicate our offerings using their own personnel. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building out new capabilities to pursue growth, including, for example, our investments in large language models. These investments increase our costs, and if these new capabilities do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. If we are not able to compete effectively in the markets we serve or if we are not able to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our customers and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers. 16"

As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan or anticipated results could impact our margins and earnings. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions and enhance our existing services, platforms and solutions, and market acceptance of these offerings. Our success is also dependent on our ability to compete with new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. The information technology and artificial intelligence (AI) industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to successfully develop services, platforms and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, and the acceptance of these services, platforms and solutions by our existing and target customers. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, platforms and solutions, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services, platforms and solutions are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services, platforms and solutions non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets. While we invest in developing and pursuing new services, platforms and solutions, our profitability could be reduced if these services, platforms and solutions do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new offerings do not generate the planned revenues. The markets for our services, platforms and solutions are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective customers who may attempt to duplicate our offerings using their own personnel. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building out new capabilities to pursue growth, including, for example, our investments in large language models. These investments increase our costs, and if these new capabilities do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. If we are not able to compete effectively in the markets we serve or if we are not able to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our customers and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers."

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies Description of Business - Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading data engineering company. The Company’s mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which the Company believes will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. The Company was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, the Company believes it is delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. The Company believes that it can contribute meaningfully by harnessing its capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. The Company is also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that its customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. The Company developed its capabilities and honed its approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately eight years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. The Company’s historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of the Company’s offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. AI Data Preparation For several of the world’s large technology companies, the Company supports their efforts at building generative AI foundation models. For these companies, the Company provides or is poised to provide a range of scaled data solutions and services. The Company’s scaled data solutions include providing instruction data sets for fine-tuning LLMs to understand prompts, to accept instruction, to converse, to apparently reason, and to perform the myriad of incredible feats that many of us have now experienced. The Company also provides reinforcement learning and reward modeling, services which are critical to provide the guardrails against toxic, bias and harmful responses, and model evaluation services. For social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, the Company collects or creates training data, annotates training data, and trains AI algorithms for working with images, text, video, audio, code and sensor data. The Company utilizes a variety of leading third-party tools, proprietary tools and customer tools. For text annotation, the Company uses its proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. The platform encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data. F-8"

The Company’s mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which the Company believes will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. The Company was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, the Company believes it is delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. The Company believes that it can contribute meaningfully by harnessing its capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. The Company is also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that its customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. The Company developed its capabilities and honed its approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately eight years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. The Company’s historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of the Company’s offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. AI Data Preparation For several of the world’s large technology companies, the Company supports their efforts at building generative AI foundation models. For these companies, the Company provides or is poised to provide a range of scaled data solutions and services. The Company’s scaled data solutions include providing instruction data sets for fine-tuning LLMs to understand prompts, to accept instruction, to converse, to apparently reason, and to perform the myriad of incredible feats that many of us have now experienced. The Company also provides reinforcement learning and reward modeling, services which are critical to provide the guardrails against toxic, bias and harmful responses, and model evaluation services. For social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, the Company collects or creates training data, annotates training data, and trains AI algorithms for working with images, text, video, audio, code and sensor data. The Company utilizes a variety of leading third-party tools, proprietary tools and customer tools. For text annotation, the Company uses its proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. The platform encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data."

(NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading data engineering company. Our mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which we believe will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. Innodata was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, we believe that we’re delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. We believe that we can contribute meaningfully by harnessing our capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. We’re also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that our customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. Market Opportunities AI Data Preparation AI applications are trained with large quantities of data, unlike traditional computer applications that use languages such as Python and Java to tell computers what to do. AI applications learn from the data through a series of regressions. Today’s highest performing AI applications (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT) would never have been possible to build through traditional programming. Data science teams at some of the largest technology companies are accelerating development of generative AI technologies that produce high quality text, code, and images in response to user prompts. At their core, they rely upon large language models (LLMs), which are deep neural networks (an artificial intelligence architecture) with billions of parameters and requiring massive amounts of training data to encode the essence of human language. They also require fine-tuning through supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to render them suitable for specialized tasks and domains, to control hallucinations (the tendency of these models to make up things on the fly), and to minimize the risk that they generate unsafe or biased results. In addition, companies across industry verticals are seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants, chatbots, content moderation, robotics, fraud detection and contract review. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform these data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. As AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical and data preparation becomes increasingly complex, data science teams seek partners with deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. ​ We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to partner with data science teams. ​ We collect or create training data, annotate training data, and train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio.

Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past seven years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below. ) Our 4,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Global Delivery Framework”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Global Delivery Framework We have over 4,000 employees and associates across 23 countries. Many of them have data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology and hold advanced degrees. We also have access to a large population of “crowdsourced” workers that we maintain in our databases. Our delivery locations are strategically located to give us access to a diverse talent base spanning multiple time zones and more than 40 languages. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently approximately 75% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. Our Technology Over the past seven years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, orchestration and cognitive processing, and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our workbenches incorporate data verification and validation algorithms to detect human expert inconsistencies and to catch difficult auto-annotation errors such as LLM hallucinations. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate ingests unstructured data and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up low-code AI with transfer learning, orchestrating generative LLMs we have developed over the past seven years of deploying industrial deep neural networks as well as third-party foundation models. It integrates both with our internal systems and customer environments through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it is “low-code”, so it does not require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we commercialized it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions. 7"

Many of them have data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology and hold advanced degrees. We also have access to a large population of “crowdsourced” workers that we maintain in our databases. Our delivery locations are strategically located to give us access to a diverse talent base spanning multiple time zones and more than 40 languages. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently approximately 75% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. Our Technology Over the past seven years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, orchestration and cognitive processing, and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our workbenches incorporate data verification and validation algorithms to detect human expert inconsistencies and to catch difficult auto-annotation errors such as LLM hallucinations. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate ingests unstructured data and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up low-code AI with transfer learning, orchestrating generative LLMs we have developed over the past seven years of deploying industrial deep neural networks as well as third-party foundation models. It integrates both with our internal systems and customer environments through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it is “low-code”, so it does not require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we commercialized it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions."

        "text": "For the past seven years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality.

It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. In January 2023, we released a module within our Agility product called PR CoPilot™ that augments the work communications professionals do to generate press releases and media outreach. It leverages proprietary Innodata technology and OpenAI’s GPT large language models. We believe PR CoPilot is the first AI writing assistant built natively into a fully-integrated PR platform. To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, and pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”), and Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of information technology resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2022, our Wide Area Network had 99.98% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. ( See “Information Security”, below. ) Our Breadth of Capabilities We are able to address customers at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without access to sophisticated data sciences support, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacks an application to analyze and manage the data, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Legacy We developed our capabilities and honed our approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately seven years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. Our historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of our offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. 8"

We believe in communicating honestly, transparently and broadly. We are optimistic in the promise of technology to augmenting human initiative and talent. We embrace diversity (and began doing so long before it was in vogue). We prize empathy and respect in our relationships with customers and colleagues alike while at the same time honing direct communication that best promotes optimal business outcomes for our customers. We believe our culture helps us best serve our customers and helps us attract and retain top people. Growth Strategy We believe that we are living in a unique time – that AI will soon become the “brains” of our computers, our robots and our cars; and that AI will be adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding. In AI, the software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data. Nowhere does the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” apply better. A data-centric approach for collection and annotation of consistent, high-quality data will separate the winners from the losers. Our strategy for growth is to leverage our 30+ year experience creating high quality data. We intend to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the creation and commercialization of increasingly sophisticated AI and deployment of AI in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past seven years. Key elements of our growth strategy include: Driving New Customer Acquisition We believe we are still in the early stages of penetrating our addressable markets. We intend to pursue new long-term, strategic customer relationships, especially with customers with large and growing commitments to AI innovation, where we can deliver a wide range of our capabilities and have meaningful impact. Beginning in 2021, we substantially scaled our sales organization, most notably the sales organization supporting our Agility PR solutions product. In late 2021 and early 2022, we experienced challenges in retaining sales hires primarily in our Austin, Texas sales office. We have since closed that sales office, have focused on hiring and retaining sales talent in other locations and in building a data-driven sales organization. We believe that the current sales organization is operating well and will likely enable us to achieve our near-term growth targets. Expanding Relationships with Existing Customers We believe we have demonstrated a clear ability to “land-and-expand” within customer accounts. Once we engage with a customer within a specific line of business and specific use cases, and the customer experiences the benefits of working with us, it will often increase the number of use cases for which it engages us and expand to additional lines of business. Continuing to Develop New Capabilities We intend to develop new capabilities designed around emerging customer needs and advances in AI technologies. We intend to develop additional charter customer relationships, like the ongoing relationship we formed with one of the world’s largest banks to co-develop an AI-enabled compliance platform. Continuing to Innovate We believe that our ability to innovate will continue to be an important contributor to our growth and market traction.

Research and Development Our Innodata Labs researches and develops AI-based technologies that we utilize in our operations and with our customers. The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction. Our product engineering teams also engage in research and development efforts focused on enhancing the functionality and utility of our AI industry platforms, addressing new use cases and developing additional innovative technologies. Timely development of new functionality to support existing and new use cases is essential to maintaining our competitive position, and we release new versions of our software on a regular basis. Customer feedback enables us to ensure that we stay aligned to our customers’ priorities and that we stay ahead of market needs. Our culture of innovation helps us attract and retain a highly motivated and talented team of AI experts and technologists. Our research and development center spans several geographical locations across North America and Asia-Pacific. In mid-2022, we formed an Advisory Board dedicated to helping drive growth through innovation initiatives and advancing dialogue related to ethical AI and the future of AI technologies. The advisory board is currently comprised by a Chief Data Officer for Microsoft and the director of University of Michigan’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Environmental, Social, and Governance We have built a robust corporate ESG program focused on social responsibility; improving how we perform as a steward of the environment; and sustainability. Social Responsibility We are driven by the vision of ushering in an era of broadly distributed, sustainable prosperity that can result from ethical AI and broad access to the benefits of AI. We have two programs underway designed to help ensure a future level playing field for marginalized or economically-disadvantaged communities that might otherwise be at a disadvantage in an increasingly AI-driven world. The first of these programs is our i-Hope Program. The aim of our i-Hope Program is to provide the gift of computer literacy to 25,000 children by 2025. From 2016 to 2022, our employees contributed over 2,300 person days to the program, building 17 fully-functional computer labs and smart classrooms across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. As a result, we believe approximately 10,300 children in these communities are now more technology proficient and better prepared to participate in opportunities that AI presents. Our efforts have been well-recognized.

As a Forbes article explained, “Suppose the data used to train your AI system doesn’t have sufficient data about specific classes of individuals. In that case, it may not learn what to do when it encounters those individuals. Would a facial recognition system used for check-in to a hotel recognize a person with freckles? If the system stops working and makes check-in harder for a person with freckles, what should the company do? How does the company address this ethical dilemma?” 10 Our global efforts at AI inclusivity span nations, geographies, gender identities, etc., with a focus on minority communities and identity groups. For example, we recently began working with Native American tribes to ensure that they are in no respect disadvantaged by next generation facial recognition systems. Environmental Stewardship We are also committed to conducting our business in a manner that manages environmental issues responsibly and contributes to global efforts to curb carbon emissions. We fulfill this commitment by our efforts to conduct operations in an environmentally-sound manner; to manage our supply chains toward appropriate environmental practices; and sponsor grass-roots efforts designed to preserve the environment in the communities in which we operate.

Our success is also dependent on our ability to compete with new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. The information technology and artificial intelligence (AI) industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to successfully develop services, platforms and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, and the acceptance of these services, platforms and solutions by our existing and target customers. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, platforms and solutions, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services, platforms and solutions are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services, platforms and solutions non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets. While we invest in developing and pursuing new services, platforms and solutions, our profitability could be reduced if these services, platforms and solutions do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new offerings do not generate the planned revenues. The markets for our services, platforms and solutions are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective customers who may attempt to duplicate our offerings using their own personnel. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building-out new capabilities to pursue growth. These investments increase our costs, and if these new capabilities do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. If we are not able to compete effectively in the markets we serve or if we are not able to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our customers and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies Description of Business - Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading data engineering company. The Company’s mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which the Company believes will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. The Company was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, the Company believes it is delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. The Company believes that it can contribute meaningfully by harnessing its capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. The Company is also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that its customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. The Company developed its capabilities and honed its approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately seven years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. The Company’s historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of the Company’s offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. AI Data Preparation The Company collects or creates training data, annotates training data, and trains AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. The Company utilizes a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, the Company uses its proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. The platform encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or rarity of cohorts and outliers), the Company creates high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage large language models (LLMs). AI Model Deployment and Integration The Company helps businesses leverage the latest AI technologies to achieve their goals. The Company develops custom AI models (where it selects the appropriate algorithms, tunes hyperparameters, trains and validates the models, and updates the models as required). The Company also helps businesses fine-tune their own custom versions of the Company’s proprietary models and third-party foundation models to address domain-specific and customer-specific use cases. In addition to deploying and integrating AI models, the Company often provides a range of data engineering support services including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data extraction, data compliance, and master data management. The Company’s customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns of the Company’s AI solutions and platforms.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AI-Enabled Industry Platforms The Company’s AI-enabled industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements the Company believes it can innovate with AI/ML technologies. The Company deploys these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. These platforms benefit from the Company’s technology infrastructure, its industry-specific knowledge, its strong customer relationships and experience merging technology with the business processes of its customers. To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”). The Company is in development with an additional AI-enabled industry platform to serve financial services institutions. The Company’s Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with its proprietary data models or customer data models. The Company’s Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and docGenix, a limited liability company that is majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the docGenix limited liability company have call and put options that can be settled in cash or stock. Accordingly, this is presented in temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, and management has made assumptions about the possible effects of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on critical and significant accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, useful life of long-lived assets, useful life of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, pension benefit plan assumptions, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s revenue is recognized when services are rendered or goods are delivered to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods as per the agreement with the customer. In cases where there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For agreements with distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are performed for the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. For the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenue from agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from fixed-fee agreements, which is not significant to overall revenues, is recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing the Company’s functional software and providing access to the Company’s hosted software platform. Revenue from such F-9"

To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”). The Company is in development with an additional AI-enabled industry platform to serve financial services institutions. The Company’s Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with its proprietary data models or customer data models. The Company’s Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and docGenix, a limited liability company that is majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the docGenix limited liability company have call and put options that can be settled in cash or stock. Accordingly, this is presented in temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, and management has made assumptions about the possible effects of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on critical and significant accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, useful life of long-lived assets, useful life of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, pension benefit plan assumptions, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s revenue is recognized when services are rendered or goods are delivered to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods as per the agreement with the customer. In cases where there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For agreements with distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are performed for the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. For the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenue from agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from fixed-fee agreements, which is not significant to overall revenues, is recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing the Company’s functional software and providing access to the Company’s hosted software platform. Revenue from such"
