        "text": "Because the markets for our self-service data preparation, visual data discovery and predictive analytics products are evolving, it is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates, customer demand for our enterprise software licenses, the size and growth rate of these markets, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. Any expansion in our markets depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with such software licenses. If the markets for our enterprise software licenses do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for software in these markets caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders, reduced renewal rates or decreased revenues, any of which would adversely affect our business operations and financial results."

        "text": "The markets for data preparation, visual data discovery and predictive analytics products are evolving rapidly. Growth in our business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products, to address the emerging needs of this market. The length of product life cycles depends in part on end-user demand for new or additional functionality in our products and our ability to update our products to meet such demands. If we fail to accurately anticipate the demand for, or encounter any significant delays in developing or introducing, new products or additional functionality in our products, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Our product life cycles can also be affected if suppliers of software systems with which we interact introduce new or changed functionality within their products. Our failure to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than our products. Such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of our products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business."

        "text": "Our self-service data preparation, visual data discovery and predictive analytics products compete with those of other companies in the Big Data and business analytics markets. These markets are highly competitive and include companies such as Tableau Software, TIBCO Spotfire (a subsidiary of TIBCO Software Inc.), Qlik Technologies, Inc., Informatica, Alteryx, Paxata, Trifacta, RapidMiner, KNIME and First Derivatives, as well as larger technology companies such as IBM, SAP, MicroStrategy, Inc., SAS and Oracle. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and/or substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. No assurance can be given that our business will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future. In addition, many of these competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business analytics industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, the business, results of operations and financial condition of the combined business would be harmed. In addition, competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows."
