Given the breadth and openness of our portfolio, we enable the Intelligent Product Lifecycle: establishing a strong product data foundation in the engineering department and democratizing the access and use of that data across the enterprise to drive cross-functional collaboration, accelerate new product introduction timelines, and deliver higher product quality. By embracing the Intelligent Product Lifecycle, our customers establish the quality, consistency, and traceability of product data, ensuring the data is up-to-date, accessible, reliable, and actionable. Our customers can then go on to use this data to break down silos, streamline workflows, and achieve interoperability across departments, functions, and systems. This includes the growing emphasis on AI-driven transformation across our customers’ teams, operations, and processes. A product data foundation is the backbone of AI-driven transformation. Our business is based on a subscription model and 95% of our 2025 revenue is recurring in nature. Compared to a perpetual license model, our subscription model naturally drives higher customer engagement and retention and provides better business predictability. This, in turn, enables us to make steady and sustained investments to support our customers and pursue mid-to-long-term growth opportunities. Our Principal Products and Services PLM software products for product data management and process orchestration Our Windchill ® PLM application suite manages all aspects of the product development lifecycle—from concept through service and end-of-life. Windchill provides real-time information sharing, dynamic data visualization, and the ability to collaborate across geographically distributed teams, enabling manufacturers to elevate their product development, manufacturing, field service, and end-of-life processes. Our Codebeamer ® and pure::variants TM application lifecycle management (ALM) solutions enable companies to accelerate the development of products that contain software, including software-defined products that require multiple software variants to be created and updated over the life of the product. Our ServiceMax ® service lifecycle management (SLM) solution enables companies to improve asset uptime with optimized in-person and remote service, boost technician productivity with the latest mobile tools, and deliver metrics for confident decision making. Our Servigistics ® service parts management solution enables companies to effectively manage their service parts inventory, enabling them to optimize equipment availability and uptime, and increase customer satisfaction. Our Arena ® Software as a Service (SaaS) PLM solution enables product teams to collaborate virtually anytime and anywhere, making it easier to share the latest product and quality information with internal teams and supply chain partners and deliver innovative products to customers faster. Our Arena quality management system software connects quality and product designs into a single system to simplify regulatory compliance. CAD software products for product data authoring Our Creo ® 3D CAD technology enables the digital design, testing, and modification of product models. With its design simulation, additive manufacturing, and generative design innovations, we enable our customers to be first to market with differentiated products. From initial concept to design, simulation, and analysis, Creo provides designers with innovative tools to efficiently create better products, faster."

        "text": "Our use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology and the incorporation of AI technology into our products carries risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities into many of our products to enable our customers to become more agile and productive. The integration of AI into our products presents risks and challenges, including that we may be unable to integrate AI technologies into our products when or as we expect, that our customers do not appreciate or realize the anticipated benefits of such technologies, that competitors may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or effectively, that our AI-based solutions could produce inaccurate results or have other unintended consequences, or that our AI-based solutions may expose us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, or other proceedings, and subject us to legal liability as well as brand and reputational harm, all of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We also use AI tools internally to make certain business processes more efficient. While these technologies offer significant benefits, they also create risks and challenges. Although we implement measures to address the accuracy and appropriate use of AI tools, including internal AI policies and training, these efforts may not always be successful. Inadvertent selection of AI tools that introduce bias, errors, or hallucinations, as well as any failure by our employees, contractors, or partners to adhere to our AI policies, or inappropriate use of AI, could result in violations of confidentiality obligations, laws, or regulations, jeopardize our intellectual property rights, or expose our products or business systems to defects and malware, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. II. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position, business and prospects. Our software products are proprietary. We protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights, trademarks, patents, and common law safeguards, including trade secret protection, as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties. Despite these measures, the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our software products and other intellectual property. In addition, we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software. If our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail, others may be able to use those rights, which could reduce our competitiveness and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be expensive, divert management’s attention from regular operations, and lead to additional claims against us, and we may not prevail, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Many of our products and services incorporate or depend on open source software components, which are governed by various open source licenses. Some of these licenses may require, as a condition of use, modification, or distribution, that we make available the source code of our proprietary software or derivative works. While we maintain policies and procedures designed to monitor and control the use of open source software in our products and in any third-party software that is incorporated into our products, and ensure compliance with applicable licenses, these controls may not be effective in all cases. If we inadvertently use open source software in a manner that triggers such disclosure obligations, we could be required to publicly disclose portions of our proprietary code, which could result in a loss of competitive advantage and intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects."
