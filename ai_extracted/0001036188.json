        "text": "Continuous product development and rapid response to change. Many manufacturers are facing increased change in their industries driven by technology that is enabling new disruptive business models. Just as manufacturers are facing changes in the markets they serve, they are also facing changes in the way they manufacture. Our ability to successfully compete depends in part on our continuous product development and rapid introduction of new technologies, features and functionality. Manufacturers are facing a swiftly changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying technologies. Traditional ERP systems were not designed to manage this rate of change in business process. The QAD Enterprise Platform enables a rapid response to change, allowing customers to align their systems to the current optimal business process without the need for intrusive customization that hinders the ability to respond to future changes. Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (“IoT”), Machine Learning (“ML”), Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), Additive Manufacturing (“3D Printing”), Blockchain, Augmented Reality, and Predictive Analytics are all examples of evolving technologies that can impact the markets in which our customers operate. We believe delivering a focused, flexible ERP system will be increasingly attractive to pragmatic manufacturers seeking a long-term fit of their business systems in support of their strategy in changing markets. We are committed to continuous investment in product development to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve."

Our ability to successfully compete depends in part on our continuous product development and rapid introduction of new technologies, features and functionality. Manufacturers are facing a swiftly changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying technologies. Industry 4.0, IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) and Digital Transformation are all examples of evolving technologies that can impact the markets in which our customers operate. Adopting these technologies, as well as responding to changes in customer demands and the competitive landscape, can require changes in our customer's business processes. Delivering agile systems that support changes in business process are a key focus of our Channel Islands program. The technologies that we have developed to provide this flexibility include: Personalization, Embedded Analytics, Modularization and Extensibility. We are committed to continuous investment in product development to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve.
