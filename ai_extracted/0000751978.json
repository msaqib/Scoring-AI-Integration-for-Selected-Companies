        "text": "FPA, which is focused on, but not limited to, 48V DC distribution solutions, increases power system conversion efficiency, density, and power delivery performance by “factorizing” (i.e., separating) the power conversion process into individual components, reducing the design limitations, thermal management challenges, and scaling trade-offs associated with conventional architectures for DC voltage distribution. All such architectures follow a sequence whereby a DC voltage is first transformed, or reduced, and that lower voltage subsequently conducted (i.e., “bussed”) across the circuit to the “load” (i.e., the point of use), where the voltage is regulated and lowered once more, to the required operating voltage of the load. In a FPA implementation, the sequence is reversed. Regulation occurs first, and the regulation module can be placed in the optimal position for space utilization and thermal management. A regulated voltage approaching 48V is bussed across the circuit to the transformation module, which performs what we refer to as current multiplication, adjacent to the load. Bussing high voltage minimizes the current levels across the circuit, thereby minimizing the potential for distribution losses and reducing the volume of the conduit (e.g., the copper wire). Placing the relatively low noise, low heat current multiplication module adjacent to the load further minimizes the potential for distribution losses associated with bussing a low operating voltage to the load and reduces the potential influence of the power system on the performance of the load. A typical FPA implementation for delivering 48V DC from a server backplane to a 1.0V microprocessor would consist of three modules: a PRM ™ (Pre-Regulator Module) regulator, a VTM ™ (Voltage Transformation Module) current multiplier, and a proprietary communications controller. In contrast, a commodity IBA design for delivering 48V DC from a server backplane to a 1.0V microprocessor requires an additional conversion stage, to reduce 48V to 12V, and, at the point of load, a voltage regulation module (i.e., a “VRM” consisting of multiple switching regulators, each representing a phase and consisting of two switching transistors, one or more capacitors, and an inductor, with the transistors switched by pulse width modulation controller). For a 200W two stage, multiphase application, a 12V commodity IBA implementation would require an intermediate bus converter, to reduce 48V to 12V, and a VRM solution consisting of parallel phases (i.e., multiple switching regulators) to reduce and regulate the current for use at 1.0V by the microprocessor. Such a commodity IBA implementation requires a significantly higher component count, consumes more motherboard area, requires more copper conduit, generates more heat due to switching and distribution losses, offers inferior dynamic response, and can be meaningfully less efficient than a 48V FPA implementation. The advantages of FPA over legacy power distribution architectures are most evident in high performance computing applications. Our “Power-on-Package” power system solutions meet the computational performance requirements of artificial intelligence (“AI”). The microprocessors typically used in AI, particularly in more computationally demanding “machine learning” or “training” applications, are graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and custom application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”). Unlike central processing units (“CPUs”), which are designed for serial execution of complex and broad instruction sets, GPUs and AI ASICs are designed for massively parallel (i.e., concurrent) processing of repetitive transactions or calculations. As such, GPUs and AI ASICs generally operate at processing frequencies requiring the higher levels of average and peak current delivered by our FPA-based solutions. Our most popular Power-on-Package solution, consists of one MCD © (Modular Current Driver) unit, providing high-bandwidth, low-noise regulation, and two MCM © (Modular Current Multiplier) units, providing high performance current multiplication. Power-on-Package delivers unprecedented current levels to GPUs and AI ASICs, in part due to the placement of the MCMs directly on the substrate onto which the processor is mounted, thereby minimizing distribution losses associated with high current levels. Placement of MCM units on the substrate also reduces the number of GPU or ASIC processor substrate pins required for power, allowing for their use by other functions (e.g., memory input/output (“I/O”)). This three-module laterally-mounted Power-on-Package configuration, powering an AI accelerator card requiring 350W, delivers 0.7V, 650A average current, and up to 1,200A peak current to the GPU or AI ASIC, with superior transient response and unmatched power density. We are unaware of any competitive solution for AI acceleration offering the power system performance and density of Power-on-Package, as IBA-based solutions must increase the number of conversion phases to reach 5"

Our latest innovation for powering processors is vertical power delivery, which involves mounting our highest-performance solutions on the underside of the motherboard, opposite the GPU or AI ASIC, thereby enabling a further reduction in distribution losses at the load, yielding higher efficiency and unprecedented power density. Vertically-mounting the solution allows unrestricted access to microprocessor input/output I/O pins on the top side of the motherboard, thereby improving I/O speed and memory access, which are a priority for GPUs and AI ASICs in AI applications. We are in the final development stages of our vertical power delivery solutions and expect to be shipping released products to customers in 2021. Our proprietary technologies enable us to offer a range of Advanced Products, in various package formats across functional families, applicable to other market segments and power distribution architectures other than FPA. Within computing, these market segments include AC to DC voltage conversion and DC voltage distribution in server racks and high voltage conversion across datacenter infrastructure. We also offer Advanced Product power system solutions for aerospace and aviation (e.g., for use in satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and various airframes, including battery-powered aircraft, for which small size, light weight, and design flexibility are advantageous); defense electronics (e.g., for use in airborne, seaborne, or field communications and radar, for which reliability in harsh environments is a priority); industrial automation, instrumentation, and test equipment (e.g., for use in robotics and semiconductor testing, for which high power levels and precision performance are required); solid state lighting (e.g., for use in large scale displays and signage, for which, again, small size, light weight, and design flexibility are advantageous); telecommunications and networking infrastructure (e.g., for use in high-throughput data distribution and pole-mounted small-cell base stations); and vehicles (e.g., in autonomous driving applications, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles). Annual revenue associated with the sale of Advanced Products was approximately 35.8%, 28.6%, and 35.9% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Sales of Advanced Products recovered in 2020, reflecting the resumption of orders from both AI system vendors and hyperscalers, as the market segment recovered from an unexpected and sustained period of low demand across the computing market that began in 2018 and continued through 2019. This low demand was caused by the buildup of excess inventory levels at contract manufacturers during the second half of 2018 and planning uncertainty associated with the ongoing trade dispute between China and the U.S., the two largest geographic markets we serve. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the data center market has experienced relatively less disruption than other market segments we serve, as the rapid expansion of cloud-based computing and AI-driven applications drove sustained demand for our solutions through 2020. We anticipate the percentage of periodic revenue associated with the sale of Advanced Products will increase in the future, given our strategic and organizational focus and the relatively higher expected growth of the market segments we serve.

We offer a wide range of brick-format DC-DC converters, as well as complementary components providing AC line rectification, input filtering, power factor correction, and transient protection. Wide ranges of input voltages, output voltages, and output power are offered, allowing end users to select components appropriate to their individual applications. The products differ in dimensions, temperature grades, maximum power ratings, performance characteristics, pin configuration, and, in certain cases, characteristics specific to the targeted market.

We are following a strategy based on the development of differentiated Advanced Products addressing what we believe to be the long-term limitations of traditional power architectures, while at the same time sustaining sales and profitability of our well-established Brick Products. The development of new, innovative products is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. Although we have introduced many Advanced Products over recent years, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and power system concepts in a timely or efficient manner. Similarly, there can be no assurance recently introduced or to be developed products will achieve customer acceptance. Our future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative Advanced Products, notably our Power-on-Package concept in AI and other high-performance applications. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these and other Advanced Products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant product development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans. We continue to shift our go-to-market strategy to focus on larger opportunities with global OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers. Our growth is therefore dependent on: the pace at which these OEMs and ODMs develop their own new products; the acceptance of our Advanced Products by these OEMs and ODMs; and the success of the customers’ products incorporating our Advanced Products. If we fail to anticipate changes in our customers’ businesses and their changing product needs or do not successfully identify and enter new markets, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted. In 2020, we further expanded our dedicated sales effort to penetrate the automotive market with our Advanced Products, notably in the rapidly expanding 48V opportunity within the electric vehicle and mild hybrid vehicle market segments. The automotive market is dominated by relatively few global OEMs and “tiers” of well-established suppliers. Penetrating this market will be challenging and we may not be successful in doing so. Additionally, our early success with vendors of AI computing solutions may not translate into long-term success with customers participating in the long-term development of autonomous driving solutions. We cannot offer any assurance the markets we currently serve will grow in the future, our Advanced Products or Brick Products will meet respective market requirements, or we can maintain adequate gross margins or operating profits in these markets. Intellectual Property Risks We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies that must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies. We devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights, and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights. This protection, however, may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products. We may be unable to protect or enforce current patents, may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict or replicate, or may be unable to acquire patents in the future, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those 22"

However, we also offer products addressing other DC voltage standards (e.g., 380V for power distribution in data centers, 110V for rail applications, 28V for military and avionics applications, and 24V for industrial automation). Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which our products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either “Advanced Products” or “Brick Products.” The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are largely used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power Architecture ™ (“FPA”), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion function. The Brick Products category largely consists of our broad and well-established families of integrated power converters, incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional power systems architectures. Given the growth profiles of the markets we serve with our Advanced Products line and our Brick Products line, our strategy involves a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in our Advanced Products line and targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in the mature market segments we serve with our Brick Products line with a high-mix, low-volume operational model. The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for voltage distribution on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure. We have established a leadership position in the emerging market segment for powering high-performance processors used for acceleration of applications associated with artificial intelligence (“AI”). Our customers in the AI market segment include the leading innovators in processor and accelerator design, as well as early adopters in cloud computing and high performance computing. We also target applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, industrial automation, instrumentation, test equipment, solid state lighting, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our Brick Products, we generally serve a fragmented base of large and small customers, concentrated in aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (notably in rail and heavy equipment applications). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience over time a greater concentration of sales among relatively fewer customers. In June 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,769,231 shares of our Common Stock, at a price to the public of $65.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $109.7 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and other general corporate purposes. Our quarterly consolidated operating results can be difficult to forecast and have been subject to significant fluctuations. We plan our production and inventory levels based on management’s estimates of customer demand, customer forecasts, and other information sources. Customer forecasts, particularly those of OEM, ODM, and contract manufacturing customers to which we supply Advanced Products in high volumes, are subject to scheduling changes on short notice, contributing to operating inefficiencies and excess costs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview A discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, on pages 35-37 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021. We design, develop, manufacture, and market modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power for use in electrically-powered devices. Our competitive position is supported by innovations in product design and achievements in product performance, largely enabled by our focus on the research and development of advanced technologies and processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies enabling power system solutions that are more efficient and much smaller than conventional alternatives. Our strategy emphasizes demonstrable product differentiation and a value proposition based on competitively superior solution performance, advantageous design flexibility, and a compelling total cost of ownership. While we offer a wide range of alternating current (“AC”) and direct current (“DC”) power conversion products, we consider our core competencies to be associated with 48V DC distribution, which offers numerous inherent cost and performance advantages over lower distribution voltages. However, we also offer products addressing other DC voltage standards (e.g., 380V for power distribution in data centers, 110V for rail applications, 28V for military and avionics applications, and 24V for industrial automation). Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which our products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either “Advanced Products” or “Brick Products.” The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are largely used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power Architecture ™ (“FPA”), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion function. The Brick Products category largely consists of our broad and well-established families of integrated power converters, incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional power systems architectures. Given the growth profiles of the markets we serve with our Advanced Products line and our Brick Products line, our strategy involves a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in our Advanced Products line and targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in the mature market segments we serve with our Brick Products line with a high-mix, low-volume operational model. The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for voltage distribution on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure. We have established a leadership position in the emerging market segment for powering high-performance processors used for acceleration of applications associated with artificial intelligence (“AI”). Our customers in the AI market segment include the leading innovators in processor and accelerator design, as well as early adopters in cloud computing and high performance computing. We also target applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, industrial automation, instrumentation, test equipment, solid state lighting, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment).

Regulation occurs first, and the regulation module can be placed in the optimal position for space utilization and thermal management. A regulated voltage approaching 48V is bussed across the circuit to the transformation module, which performs what we refer to as current multiplication, adjacent to the load. Bussing high voltage minimizes the current levels across the circuit, thereby minimizing the potential for distribution losses and reducing the volume of the conduit (e.g., the copper wire). Placing the relatively low noise, low heat transformation module adjacent to the load further minimizes the potential for distribution losses associated with bussing a low operating voltage to the load and reduces the potential influence of the power system on the performance of the load. A typical FPA implementation for delivering 48V DC from a server backplane to a 1.0V microprocessor would consist of three modules: a PRM ™ (Pre-Regulator Module) regulator, a VTM ™ (Voltage Transformation Module) current multiplier, and a proprietary communications controller. In contrast, a commodity IBA design for delivering 48V DC from a server backplane to a 1.0V microprocessor requires an additional conversion stage, to reduce 48V to 12V, and a multiphase voltage regulation module (i.e., a “VRM” consisting of multiple switching regulators, each representing a phase and consisting of two switching transistors, a capacitor, and an inductor, with the transistors switched by separate pulse width modulation controller). For a 200W two stage, multiphase application, a 12V commodity IBA implementation would require an intermediate bus converter, to reduce 48V to 12V, and a VRM consisting of 10 phases and a controller to reduce and regulate the 12V current for use at 1V by the microprocessor. Such a commodity IBA design requires a significantly higher component count, consumes more motherboard area, requires more copper conduit, generates more heat due to switching and distribution losses, and can be meaningfully less efficient than a 48V FPA implementation. As microprocessor operating voltages have declined and operating currents increased, commodity IBA implementations, given the fundamental constraints of the architecture, have not met the power system conversion efficiency, density, and power delivery performance delivered by FPA. The advantages of FPA over legacy power distribution architectures are most evident in high performance computing applications. Our “Power-on-Package” power system solution meets the computational performance requirements of artificial intelligence (“AI”). The microprocessors typically used in AI, particularly in more computationally demanding “machine learning” or “training” applications, are graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and custom application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”). Both GPUs and ASICs, in contrast to CPUs, are designed for parallel processing throughput, not serial execution of complex instruction sets. As such, higher levels of average and peak current are required to achieve this throughput. Our most popular Power-on-Package solution, a re-integration of the functions of our PRM-VTM configuration, consists of one MCD © (“Modular Current Driver”) unit, providing high-bandwidth, low-noise regulation, and two MCM © (“Modular Current Multiplier”) units, providing high performance current multiplication. Power-on-Package delivers unprecedented current levels to GPUs and ASICs, in part due to the placement of the MCMs directly on the substrate onto which the processor is mounted, thereby minimizing distribution losses associated with high current levels. Placement of MCM units on the substrate also reduces the number of GPU or ASIC processor substrate pins required for power, allowing for their use by other functions (e.g., memory I/O). A typical four-module laterally-mounted Power-on-Package configuration powering a GPU requiring 350W delivers 0.7V, 500A average current, and up to 1,000A peak current, with superior transient response and unmatched power density. In 2019, we introduced vertically-mounted versions of our Power-on-Package solution, which, by being mounted directly to the underside of the GPU or ASIC, achieves a further 10 times reduction in distribution losses at the load over our laterally-mounted solution. Vertically-mounting the solution allows unrestricted access to microprocessor input/output (“I/O”) pins on the top side of the motherboard, thereby improving memory access, which is a priority for GPUs and ASICs in AI applications.

        "text": "Products most often compete with solutions offered by large integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), which offer integrated circuits and semiconductor-based modules. These IDMs generally offer far broader product portfolios, possess far greater global manufacturing and support resources, and have the ability to aggressively price their products to defend market share. Accordingly, Advanced Products are positioned as highly differentiated alternatives to commodity solutions for customers seeking high levels of performance. The customers we serve with Advanced Products, typically on a direct basis, are in market segments generally characterized by an emphasis on product performance differentiation, a compelling TCO, relatively extended and highly competitive design cycles, and product life cycles of generally less than three years. In contrast, the Brick Products competitive landscape is relatively fragmented, with large-scale, low-cost global suppliers of commodity solutions and many smaller manufacturers focused on specialized products or narrowly defined market segments or geographies. The market segments we serve with Brick Products, typically through sales representatives and distribution partners, generally are characterized by relatively short design cycles, relatively long (i.e., greater than three years) product life cycles, and, given the maturity of many market segments and applications, degrees of commoditization and price competition. As such, Brick Products are positioned with an emphasis on mass customization, through which we offer products with specific features and performance profiles typically not available from catalog-oriented competitors. The size and growth characteristics of the markets we serve with Advanced Products and Brick Products also can differ significantly, and the range and quality of market data is problematic, making summary statements about these markets challenging. We believe our Advanced Products generally compete with power modules and power integrated circuits (“ICs”) developed and manufactured by IDMs and other fabless vendors of discrete power semiconductors. Based on available third-party industry assessments, we believe the global market for all categories of power semiconductor devices exceeds $40 billion annually and is expected to grow over the next five years at a compounded annual rate between 4% and 5%. We estimate the addressable market for power modules and power ICs in market segments we are targeting exceeded $7 billion in 2019 and, after recently slowed growth, is expected to resume annual growth rates well above those of the global market as a whole. We believe the market segments (and applications) we are targeting, primarily the data center segment of the enterprise computing market, driven by adoption of AI applications, and the electric and mild hybrid segments of the automotive market, driven by customer adoption of 48V distribution, should grow over the next five years at compounded annual rates exceeding 10%. We believe our Brick Products generally compete with similarly integrated switching power supply products developed and manufactured by large global competitors and a fragmented group of small regional competitors. The switching power supply market can be segmented by product type (i.e., DC-DC converters, AC-DC converters, and DC-AC inverters), by output power levels, and by numerous vertical markets (i.e., industry-specific applications). Available third party industry assessments estimate the total global merchant (i.e., non-captive) market for AC-DC and DC-DC switching power supplies currently exceeds $25 billion of annual revenue, although as much as three-quarters of this total is associated by market analysts with AC-DC converters, primarily used in consumer applications. Accordingly, we estimate the addressable market for switching power supplies (and related products) in market segments we are targeting exceeded $4 billion in 2019. Estimates of total market compounded annual growth rates for the next five years are as high as 6%, but reflect relatively high growth in market segments in which we do not compete (e.g., solar inverters). We believe compounded annual growth rates in the smaller, well-defined market segments we serve are likely to approximate the annual growth of industrial output of the regions in which we operate. Across all geographies, Brick Products revenue has experienced low to middle single-digit growth over the three years prior to 2019. Given the maturity and fragmentation of the market segments in which we compete and our competitive positioning within these market segments, we anticipate revenue for Brick Products will continue to follow trends in industrial activity on a regional basis, with expectations of continued stability in U.S. segments and changes in export activity varying with economic conditions in Europe and Asia, with Chinese demand further influenced by the China — U.S. trade dispute. In 2019, the Chinese government increased its pressure on Chinese manufacturers to meet the 8"

        "text": "Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market differentiated, leading-edge power conversion products for larger customers, potentially contributing to lengthy product development and sales cycles that may result in significant expenditures before revenues are generated. Our future operating results are dependent on the growth in such customers’ businesses and on our ability to profitably develop and deliver products meeting customer requirements. The power system industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, quickened product obsolescence, and price erosion for mature products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are following a strategy based on the development of differentiated Advanced Products addressing what we believe to be the long-term limitations of traditional power architectures, while at the same time sustaining sales and profitability of our well-established Brick Products. The development of new, innovative products is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. Although we have introduced many Advanced Products over recent years, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and power system concepts in a timely or efficient manner. Similarly, there can be no assurance recently introduced or to be developed products will achieve customer acceptance. Our future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative Advanced Products, notably our Power-on-Package concept in AI and other high-performance applications. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these and other Advanced Products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant product development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans. We continue to shift our go-to-market strategy to focus on larger opportunities with global OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers. Our growth is therefore dependent on: the pace at which these OEMs and ODMs develop their own new products; the acceptance of our Advanced Products by these OEMs and ODMs; and the success of the customers’ products incorporating our Advanced Products. If we fail to anticipate changes in our customers’ businesses and their changing product needs or do not successfully identify and enter new markets, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted. In 2019, we expanded our dedicated sales effort to penetrate the automotive market with our Advanced Products, notably in the rapidly expanding 48V opportunity within the electric vehicle and mild hybrid vehicle market segments. The automotive market is dominated by relatively few global OEMs and “tiers” of well-established suppliers. Penetrating this market will be challenging and we may not be successful in doing so. Additionally, our early success with vendors of AI computing solutions may not translate into long-term success with customers participating in the long-term development of autonomous driving solutions. We cannot offer any assurance the markets we currently serve will grow in the future, our Advanced Products or Brick Products will meet respective market requirements, or we can maintain adequate gross margins or operating profits in these markets.

Our strategy has evolved with a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in Advanced Products, targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in mature market segments we serve with Brick Products with a high-mix, low-volume operational model. Dr. Vinciarelli and management began to make incremental changes in management practices and organizational structure based on a management plan established in 2018 for the definitive reconfiguration of the three business units into one business focused on the Advanced Products and Brick Products product line categorizations, including three significant changes: the merger of Picor with and into Vicor, which was completed on May 30, 2018; the reconfiguration of our internal reporting systems, which was completed on December 31, 2018; and the merger of VI Chip with and into Vicor, which was completed on June 28, 2019. Our CODM now determines the allocation of our resources based upon the two product line groupings, which constitute one segment. Both product lines are built in our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, employing similar processing and production techniques, are supported by the same sales and marketing organization, and address a continuum of customer applications. As such, we have conformed our segment reporting to the new reporting structure utilized by the CODM. Revenue from the sale of Advanced Products represents the sum of third-party sales of the products sold under the Advanced Products line, which were sold under the former Picor and VI Chip operating segments during periods prior to the second quarter of 2019. Revenue from the sale of Brick Products represents the sum of third-party sales of the products sold under the Brick Products line, which were sold under the former Brick Business Unit operating segment, inclusive of such sales of our Vicor Custom Power and Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. (“VJCL”) subsidiaries. When reporting such revenue on a consolidated basis, intra-segment revenues are eliminated. The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently are concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for voltage distribution on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure, although we also target applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, industrial automation, instrumentation, test equipment, solid state lighting, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our Brick Products, we generally serve a fragmented base of large and small customers, concentrated in aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (notably in rail and heavy equipment applications). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience over time a greater concentration of sales among relatively fewer customers. 2019 Results Our overall operating results declined for 2019, compared to 2018, due to an overall 17.7 % year over year decrease in bookings, with 31.2% and 10.1% decreases in Advanced Products and Brick Products bookings, respectively. Consolidated revenue for 2019 declined 9.7%. Factors contributing to the decline in bookings and revenue were customer delays in the launch of new Advanced Products programs for use in Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and supercomputing, for which we had achieved design wins, reduced shipments of Advanced Products for existing data center applications due to excess inventory in the server supply chain, reduced bookings and shipments of Brick Products to Chinese customers due to the costs of import tariffs and uncertainties associated with the China — U.S. trade dispute, and continued weakness in industrial market segments served with Brick Products in Japan and certain European countries. We experienced increased bookings and revenue for 2019 in recently targeted market segments (e.g., Advanced Products applications in automotive and commercial lighting applications), but such increases were not of sufficient volume to meaningfully offset declines in larger, established market segments and geographies. 29"

Market and Macroeconomic Considerations • We continue to believe the transition from 12V to 48V distribution in data centers is expanding and will be sustained, as an increasing number of hyperscaler and high performance computing customers are evaluating our FPA components and placing orders for Advanced Products solutions. Our Power-on-Package solution powering graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) used in Artificial Intelligence applications continued to receive strong customer interest in 2019, and we secured additional design wins. In April 2019, we entered into a design collaboration with a significant Asia-based vendor of advanced processor packaging solutions. However, despite greater customer interest and additional design wins, conditions in the data center market segment through 2019 caused customers and potential customers to delay shipments and/or bookings. We believe the excess inventories that existed across the server supply chain from late 2018 through 2019 have been reduced, and that existing customer programs are resuming and new orders will accelerate through 2020. Similarly, we believe the launch of certain new products into which Advanced Products have been designed will no longer be delayed, given improved demand visibility of the customers associated with these new products. Although we believe the inventory excesses in the server supply chain have been remedied, leading to improved customer visibility for hyperscaler and data center customers, recurring uncertainties, such as those associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China, may cause orders from new and existing customers to be delayed, potentially influencing our financial results and capacity expansion plans. • We also are confident the transition from 12V to 48V distribution in automotive applications is expanding, as automobile manufacturers broaden their offerings of electric vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles, the performance of which is significantly enhanced through the use of 48V distribution. During 2019, we expanded our dedicated automotive effort to address the increasing interest in our small, light-weight, and efficient Advanced Products. The number of domestic, European, and Japanese OEMs and Tier One suppliers with which we are engaged approximately doubled in 2019, with substantive design wins for certain all-electric and mild-hybrid vehicles models. However, because the design-to-production cycle in the automotive industry exceeds three years, we do not anticipate significant revenue from these engagements or our design wins until 2023. Currently, recognized revenue is limited primarily to development fees and low volume shipments of prototype products. As such, there is a possibility our profitability may be negatively affected by the costs of our expanded automotive effort incurred prior to the volume shipments we expect to begin in 2023. • With the expanding adoption of 48V distribution in our targeted market segments, we are facing a more complex competitive landscape, with additional challenges and competitors. We continue to believe our new products will be adopted in volume by multiple leading customers, as the level of engagement with high profile, global customers remains high. However, we cannot control the actions by, or the timing of, significant competitors also participating in the market. Many of these competitors possess resources far greater than our resources and have operational and financial flexibility we do not. Many of these vendors also have the ability to aggressively price their products to defend market share. Such aggressive pricing may influence our own pricing and, in turn, our profitability. • We anticipate aggregate demand for the mature markets we serve with our Brick Products will grow over the long-term at the rate of the overall industrial economy (i.e., in the United States, for example, at the rate of growth approximating that of the industrial segments of gross domestic product). Given our long-term customer relationships and the status of our Brick Products in long-standing customer applications, we anticipate maintaining our share in many of these mature markets.

        "text": "space utilization and thermal management. A regulated voltage approaching 48V is bussed across the circuit to the transformation module, which performs what we refer to as current multiplication, adjacent to the load. Bussing high voltage minimizes the current levels across the circuit, thereby minimizing the potential for distribution losses and reducing the volume of the conduit (e.g., the copper wire). Placing the relatively low noise, low heat current multiplication module adjacent to the load further minimizes the potential for distribution losses associated with bussing a low operating voltage to the load and reduces the potential influence of the power system on the performance of the load. A typical FPA implementation for delivering 48V DC from a server backplane to a 1.0V microprocessor would consist of three modules: a PRM ™ (Pre-Regulator Module) regulator, a VTM ™ (Voltage Transformation Module) current multiplier, and a proprietary communications controller. In contrast, a commodity IBA design for delivering 48V DC from a server backplane to a 1.0V microprocessor requires an additional conversion stage, to reduce 48V to 12V, and, at the point of load, a voltage regulation module (i.e., a “VRM” consisting of multiple switching regulators, each representing a phase and consisting of two switching transistors, one or more capacitors, and an inductor, with the transistors switched by pulse width modulation controller). For a 200W two stage, multiphase application, a 12V commodity IBA implementation would require an intermediate bus converter, to reduce 48V to 12V, and a VRM solution consisting of parallel phases (i.e., multiple switching regulators) to reduce and regulate the current for use at 1.0V by the microprocessor. Such a commodity IBA implementation requires a significantly higher component count, consumes more motherboard area, requires more copper conduit, generates more heat due to switching and distribution losses, offers inferior dynamic response, and can be meaningfully less efficient than a 48V FPA implementation. The advantages of FPA over legacy power distribution architectures are most evident in high performance computing applications. Our “Power-on-Package” power system solutions meet the computational performance requirements of artificial intelligence (“AI”). The microprocessors typically used in AI, particularly in more computationally demanding “machine learning” or “training” applications, are graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and custom application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”). Unlike central processing units (“CPUs”), which are designed for serial execution of complex and broad instruction sets, GPUs and AI ASICs are designed for massively parallel (i.e., concurrent) processing of repetitive transactions or calculations. As such, GPUs and AI ASICs generally operate at processing frequencies requiring the higher levels of average and peak current delivered by our FPA-based solutions. Our most popular Power-on-Package solution, consists of one MCD © (Modular Current Driver) unit, providing high-bandwidth, low-noise regulation, and two MCM © (Modular Current Multiplier) units, providing high performance current multiplication. Power-on-Package delivers unprecedented current levels to GPUs and AI ASICs, in part due to the placement of the MCMs directly on the substrate onto which the processor is mounted, thereby minimizing distribution losses associated with high current levels. Placement of MCM units on the substrate also reduces the number of GPU or ASIC processor substrate pins required for power, allowing for their use by other functions (e.g., memory input/output (“I/O”)). This three-module laterally-mounted Power-on-Package configuration, powering an AI accelerator card requiring 350W, delivers 0.7V, 650A average current, and up to 1,200A peak current to the GPU or AI ASIC. We are unaware of any competitive solution for AI acceleration offering the power system performance and density of Power-on-Package, as IBA-based solutions must increase the number of conversion phases to reach high current levels, thereby increasing component count and motherboard area used, which contributes to higher switching and distribution losses, inferior dynamic response, and associated heat generation. Our latest innovation for powering processors is vertical power delivery, which involves mounting our highest-performance solutions on the underside of the motherboard, opposite the GPU or AI ASIC, thereby enabling a further reduction in distribution losses at the load, yielding higher efficiency and unprecedented power density. Vertically-mounting the solution allows unrestricted access to microprocessor input/output I/O pins on the top side of the motherboard, thereby improving I/O speed and memory access, which are a priority for GPUs and AI ASICs in AI applications. We are in the final development stages of our vertical power delivery solutions and shipped prototype products to a certain customer in 2022. 5"

We also offer Advanced Product power system solutions for aerospace and aviation (e.g., for use in satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and various airframes, including battery-powered aircraft, for which small size, light weight, and design flexibility are advantageous); defense electronics (e.g., for use in airborne, seaborne, or field communications and radar, for which reliability in harsh environments is a priority); industrial automation, instrumentation, and test equipment (e.g., for use in robotics and semiconductor testing, for which high power levels and precision performance are required); solid state lighting (e.g., for use in large scale displays and signage, for which, again, small size, light weight, and design flexibility are advantageous); telecommunications and networking infrastructure (e.g., for use in high-throughput data distribution and pole-mounted small-cell base stations); and vehicles (e.g., in autonomous driving applications, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles). Annual revenue associated with the sale of Advanced Products was approximately 61.0%, 47.4%, and 35.8% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Advanced Products revenue grew in 2022 primarily due to cloud computing infrastructure growth and the further adoption of AI systems within the cloud. We anticipate the percentage of periodic revenue associated with the sale of Advanced Products will increase in the future, given our strategic and organizational focus and the relatively higher expected growth of the market segments we serve. Brick Products Brick-format converters provide the integrated transformation, rectification, isolation, regulation, filtering, and/or input protection necessary to power and protect loads, across a range of conventional power architectures. We offer a wide range of brick-format DC-DC converters, as well as complementary components providing AC line rectification, input filtering, power factor correction, and transient protection. Wide ranges of input voltages, output voltages, and output power are offered, allowing end users to select components appropriate to their individual applications. The products differ in dimensions, temperature grades, maximum power ratings, performance characteristics, pin configuration, and, in certain cases, characteristics specific to the targeted market. We also integrate these converters and components into complete power systems representing standard or custom AC-DC and DC-DC solutions for our customers’ power needs. We refer to such standard products as our “Configurable” product line, while our two Vicor Custom Power subsidiaries design, sell, and service custom power system solutions. We market our standard Brick Products emphasizing “mass customization,” using highly automated, efficient, domestic manufacturing to serve customers with product design and performance requirements, across a wide range of worldwide market segments, which could not be met by high-volume oriented competitors. We focus on distributed power implementations, for which our brick-format products are well-suited, in market segments such as aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (e.g., rail).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview A discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, on pages 33-37 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022. We design, develop, manufacture, and market modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power for use in electrically-powered devices. Our competitive position is supported by innovations in product design and achievements in product performance, largely enabled by our focus on the research and development of advanced technologies and processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies enabling power system solutions that are more efficient and much smaller than conventional alternatives. Our strategy emphasizes demonstrable product differentiation and a value proposition based on competitively superior solution performance, advantageous design flexibility, and a compelling total cost of ownership. While we offer a wide range of alternating current (“AC”) and direct current (“DC”) power conversion products, we consider our core competencies to be associated with 48V DC distribution, which offers numerous inherent cost and performance advantages over lower distribution voltages. However, we also offer products addressing other DC voltage standards (e.g., 380V for power distribution in data centers, 110V for rail applications, 28V for military and avionics applications, and 24V for industrial automation). Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which our products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either “Advanced Products” or “Brick Products.” The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are largely used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power Architecture ™ (“FPA”), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion function. The Brick Products category largely consists of our broad and well-established families of integrated power converters, incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional power systems architectures. Given the growth profiles of the markets we serve with our Advanced Products line and our Brick Products line, our strategy involves a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in our Advanced Products line and targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in the mature market segments we serve with our Brick Products line with a high-mix, low-volume operational model. The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for voltage distribution on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure.

Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which the products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either Advanced Products or Brick Products. We also sell a range of electrical and mechanical accessories for use with our products. Advanced Products We continue to invest in the research and development of power system technologies and product concepts addressing two accelerating trends, the first toward higher required conversion efficiencies, and the second toward more and diverse on-board voltages, higher performance demands of complex loads, and, in particular, higher current requirements of those loads. These trends are most visible in the microprocessor-based applications we target with Advanced Products, for which energy consumption, energy efficiency, processor performance, and computing density are critical priorities. Recognizing the performance and scale limitations of conventional power distribution architectures and products, we introduced FPA and a range of enabling products incorporating our latest advances in switching topologies, materials, and packaging. FPA, which is focused on, but not limited to, 48V distribution solutions, increases power system conversion efficiency, density, and power delivery performance by “factorizing” (i.e., separating) the power conversion process into individual components, free of the design limitations and performance and scaling trade-offs associated with conventional power distribution architectures requiring additional conversion stages and higher component count. FPA implementation allows for a factorized bus voltage to be distributed efficiently to the point-of-load, at which the voltage is converted to the required lower voltage and higher current. In contrast to the 12V IBA distribution commonly used in computing, for the same power requirements, factorized 48V distribution reduces the number of conversion stages required, thereby reducing component count and conserving space, reduces system distribution losses, and delivers improved thermal performance, thereby reducing system cooling challenges. Such direct conversion also improves system responsiveness. As power requirements increase, the differentiated advantages of FPA increase, as our factorized power system solutions deliver unmatched system conversion efficiencies, power densities, thermal profiles, and application performance. Our FPA implementations with supercomputer and hyperscale datacenter customers involve our PRM ® (Pre-Regulator Module), to create a non-isolated, factorized 48V bus voltage at relatively low current, and our VTM ® (Voltage Transformation Module), a current multiplier delivering the required high current to the central processing unit (“CPU”). A typical 48V server motherboard implementation of FPA, utilizing a PRM-VTM configuration to power a CPU requiring less than 200W, would typically deliver 1.8V and 95A average current, with far fewer components and far less required motherboard space than competitive, multi-stage solutions with lower system conversion efficiency. In 2017, we introduced our next generation of power system solution, “Power-on-Package,” which was specifically developed to meet the computational performance requirements of artificial intelligence (“AI”). The microprocessors typically used in AI, particularly in more computationally demanding “machine learning” applications, are graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and custom application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”). Both GPUs and ASICs, in contrast to CPUs, are designed for parallel processing throughput, not execution of complex instruction sets.

If we fail to develop and commercialize leading-edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality, and introduce them to the market on a timely basis, our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market differentiated, leading-edge power conversion products for larger customers, potentially contributing to lengthy product development and sales cycles that may result in significant expenditures before revenues are generated. Our future operating results are dependent on the growth in such customers’ businesses and on our ability to profitably develop and deliver products meeting customer requirements. The power system industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, quickened product obsolescence, and price erosion for mature products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are following a strategy based on the development of differentiated Advanced Products addressing what we believe to be the long-term limitations of traditional power architectures, while at the same time sustaining sales and profitability of our well-established Brick Products. The development of new, innovative products is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. Although we have introduced many Advanced Products over the past three years, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and power system concepts in a timely or efficient manner. Similarly, there can be no assurance recently introduced or to be developed products will achieve customer acceptance. Our future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative Advanced Products, notably our Power-on-Package concept in AI and other high-performance applications. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these and other Advanced Products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant product development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans. We continue to shift our go-to-market strategy to focus on larger opportunities with global OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers. Our growth is therefore dependent on: the pace at which these OEMs and ODMs develop their own new products; the acceptance of our Advanced Products by these OEMs and ODMs; and the success of the customers’ products incorporating our Advanced Products. If we fail to anticipate changes in our customers’ businesses and their changing product needs or do not successfully identify and enter new markets, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted. In 2018, we established a dedicated sales effort to penetrate the automotive market with our Advanced Products, notably in rapidly expanding 48V “mild hybrid” segment. The automotive market is dominated by relatively few global OEMs and “tiers” of well-established suppliers. Penetrating this market will be challenging and we may not be successful in doing so. Additionally, our early success with vendors of AI computing solutions may not translate into long-term success with customers participating in the long-term development of autonomous driving solutions. We cannot offer any assurance the markets we currently serve will grow in the future, our Advanced Products or Brick Products will meet respective market requirements, or we can maintain adequate gross margins or operating profits in these markets. 14"

        "text": "Our future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative Advanced Products, notably our Power-on-Package concept in AI and other high-performance applications. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these and other Advanced Products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant product development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans."

However, many of these opportunities are in early phases of development, and near-term revenue growth may not be sufficient to further reduce the percentages of revenue represented by our operating expenses or to levels comparable to our high volume competitors. Market and Macroeconomic Considerations • Based on current customer activity, an expanding customer list, and an expanding backlog, we believe the 48V to point-of-load opportunity has entered an accelerated, second phase of development, with a broadening of interest, as well as the entry of new vendors offering 48V solutions. Our Power-on-Package solution powering GPUs and ASICs used in AI applications has received strong customer interest, and we have secured significant design wins for the solution. We also believe customer interest in the application of 48V distribution to server racks and datacenter infrastructure is accelerating. As such, we likely will face a more complex competitive landscape, with additional challenges and competitors. We continue to believe our new products will be adopted in volume by multiple leading customers, as the number of OEMs, ODMs, hyperscalers, and cloud services providers with which we are engaged in development activities expanded in 2018. However, we cannot control the actions by, or the timing of, our customers, their contract manufacturers, or the significant vendors also participating in the market. Many of these vendors possess resources far greater than we do and have operational and financial flexibility we do not. Notably, our outlook for 2019 bookings and shipments of Power-on-Package solutions has been influenced by the sudden, fourth quarter shift in the confidence of our customers regarding supercomputing and high performance computing spending, particularly in China. Despite recent and anticipated design wins, as well as the strong momentum of AI computing through the year, recent customer uncertainty may cause orders from new and existing customers to be delayed, with a likely influence on our financial results and capacity expansion plans. • We anticipate aggregate demand for the mature markets we serve with our Brick Products will grow over the long-term only at the rate of the overall industrial economy (i.e., in the United States, for example, at the rate of growth approximating that of the industrial segments of gross domestic product). Given our long-standing customer relationships and the status of our Brick Products in long-standing customer applications, we anticipate maintaining our share in many of these mature markets. While we are pursuing opportunities to replace many Brick Products used in existing customers’ applications with Advanced Products, when appropriate, and, similarly, to replace competitors’ products in existing applications, we believe such opportunities may not cumulatively contribute to expanding, in 2019, our share of the mature markets we serve with our Brick Products. 2018 Financial Highlights • Net revenues increased 27.8% to $291,220,000 for 2018, from $227,830,000 for 2017, primarily due to an overall 26.9% increase in bookings in 2018, compared to 2017, with significant increases across all operating segments. • Export sales, as a percentage of total revenues, represented approximately 62.0% in 2018 and 63.2% in 2017. • Gross margin increased to $138,971,000 for 2018, from $101,656,000 for 2017. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues increased to 47.7% for 2018 from 44.6% for 2017. The increases were primarily due to the increase in net revenues, driving higher overhead absorption, broadly improved average selling prices, and an improved mix of products shipped. • Backlog, representing the total of orders for products received for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months, was approximately $102,963,000 at the end of 2018, as compared to $73,054,000 at the end of 2017. The increase in backlog was due to increased bookings across all operating segments, as noted above. 28"
