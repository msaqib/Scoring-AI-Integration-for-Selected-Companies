        "text": "The Company continues to explore opportunities to enhance the efficiency of its cost and organizational structure, which includes actions to restructure its cost base. The rapidly changing environment in which the Company operates increases the risk that not all of the Company's strategic initiatives will deliver the expected benefits within the anticipated timeframes. The Company's ability to achieve certain of the anticipated cost savings could be dependent on the use of AI and other technologies and the Company may not be successful implementing such technologies. In addition, these efforts may disrupt business activities or the ability of the Company to take advantage of potential growth opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company's business prospects, financial condition, and performance."

        "text": "The Company operates in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid change, including, in particular, changes in customer preferences and changes and advances in relevant technologies, including rapid advances in artificial intelligence (“AI”). There are substantial uncertainties associated with the Company’s efforts to develop successful trade publishing, educational, and media products and services, including digital products and services, for its customers, as well as to adapt its print and other materials to new digital technologies, such as the internet cloud technologies, tablets, mobile and other devices and school-based technologies and uncertainties involving the use of AI in connection with the foregoing. The Company makes significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable, or whose profitability may be significantly lower than the Company anticipates or has experienced historically. In particular, in the context of the Company’s current focus on key digital opportunities, the markets are continuing to develop and the Company may be unsuccessful in establishing itself as a significant factor in any relevant market segment which does develop. Many aspects of markets which could develop for children and schools, such as the nature of the relevant software and devices or hardware, the size of the market, relevant methods of delivery and relevant content, as well as pricing models, are still evolving and will, most likely, be subject to change on a recurring basis until a pattern develops and becomes more defined. This could specifically impact the Company's ability to execute on a digital and print literacy solution, which requires a multi-year investment, through internal development, third party providers and/or acquisitions. In addition, the Company faces market risks associated with systems development and service delivery in its evolving school ordering and ecommerce businesses, as well as in responding to changes in how schools plan to utilize technology for virtual or remote learning and the potential impact on the demand for printed materials in schools."

        "text": "The Company’s products generally comprise intellectual property delivered through a variety of media. The ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on the Company’s ability to defend its intellectual property against infringement, as well as the breadth of rights obtained. The Company’s ability to do so is subject to the legal protections available under intellectual property laws in the U.S. and other applicable jurisdictions. Unauthorized parties may attempt to illegally use the Company’s intellectual property and the measures that are available for us to enforce our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to fully address or prevent all third-party infringement. Further, it is possible that AI and other advanced technologies will make unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property more feasible and enforcement of our intellectual property rights more difficult as intellectual property becomes easier to replicate or use without authorization."
