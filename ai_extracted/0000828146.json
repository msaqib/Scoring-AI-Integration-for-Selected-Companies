Our piezoelectric sensor solutions can be used in force-sensing, impact and vibration detection, contact microphones, air/liquid flow detection, ultrasonic transducers and many other settings. They have applications in medical vital sign monitoring, industrial solid-state switches, structural health and condition monitoring, touch and tactile sensing and motion sensing amongst others. We believe this portfolio expansion will incorporate other complementary sensing technologies and will allow us to use our expertise in integrating multiple sensing technologies for applications in the rapidly growing IoT market. We have already begun integrating our force sensing technology into our recently acquired Calman membrane keypad product line to create unique solutions not offered by others in this market. Gas and Environmental Sensors. We entered the gas and environmental sensing market in 2022 through our acquisition of the business assets of SPEC Sensors, LLC (“SPEC”) and KWJ Engineering, Inc. (“KWJ”), early pioneers in miniaturized, low-cost gas and environmental sensing technologies. We now offer electrochemical gas-sensing technology products and solutions for industry, community, health and home, with uses in fields such as safety, personal wellness and air quality monitoring. Our gas and environmental sensors operations focus on three primary business activities: ● Proprietary Product Lines . We provide an extensive line of miniature, low-power, robust electrochemical sensor elements for detecting several common as well as complex gaseous compounds. These sensors are most suited for consumer and commercial IoT applications, as well as industrial and other demanding usage scenarios. Additionally, we offer our own line of full-function instruments, including, for example, Eco Sensors™ ozone monitors; a family of inline monitors for carbon monoxide and other gases; a low-pressure alarm to notify users when tanks for life-critical gases such as oxygen and nitrogen need to be replenished; and sensor modules for air quality monitoring in “smart city” projects and IoT applications. ● Custom Design and Engineering . For customers requiring specialized design and engineering work on new products incorporating gas and environmental sensing, we offer custom-built sensors and modules, circuit design and optimization, advanced characterization and compensation techniques, development of operating firmware and algorithms, enclosure design and implementation, and testing and calibration. Examples include the world’s first carbon monoxide shutoff for portable generators and a rapid transdermal alcohol detector that can serve as a barrier to starting a vehicle while intoxicated. ● In-House R&D . We have been successful in obtaining Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grants from government agencies such as the NIST, NASA, the NIH, the USDA, the NSF, the EPA, and others, that have enabled us to conduct research and development and develop new products. For example, SPEC’s Screen-Printed Electrochemical Sensor technology was developed in part under NSF Phase I, II and IIB grants. Recent SBIR-funded projects include wildfire air pollution monitoring and firefighter safety devices, transdermal blood alcohol monitors, a simple lead test for drinking water safety, a grant to enable large-scale, mass-manufacturing of printed electrochemical gas sensors, and an intelligent AI-based sensing approach for monitoring plant health in greenhouses or traditional agricultural fields. We have an established track record in winning awards for this advanced research and we continue to submit proposals for funding for strategically relevant research projects that we could commercialize in the future.

These properties enable us to create thin, light-weight, and flexible dynamic strain gauges and vibration sensors. These sensors have a very broad frequency band and are suitable for many applications. They are extremely rugged and can be used for high impact force-sensing applications, and can also be implemented on large areas and curved surfaces. In addition, they have high voltage sensitivity and simple interface electronics.

We have developed sophisticated algorithms and firmware that allows our FSR ® and piezo sensor technology to become a complete solution delivering effective HMI functionality to our customers. We are now also using machine learning and artificial intelligence to further enhance the user experience and provide compelling solutions for our customers. The acquisitions of Calman and Conductive Transfers have given us manufacturing capabilities in the UK market and close to the European market, providing custom solutions in a broad range of sectors, including the medical and diagnostic sensor marketplace. The integration of our force-sensing technology into these capabilities is already underway and offers significant improvement in the design options available to our customers. Our solutions fall into two categories, custom and standard: Custom Solutions . We offer a comprehensive portfolio of standard solutions, from simple force and piezo sensors to multi-finger capable rugged trackpads. The largest part of our business, however, is the development and manufacture of custom solutions for our major customers. We offer full integration capability spanning initial concept to large-volume manufacturing. Custom solutions can be a single- or multi-technology platform to meet customer requirements and include both input and output technologies. We also offer full embedded firmware development and integration support. In many instances, we work very closely with our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners from the concept phase to ensure that our solutions are successfully integrated. Standard Solutions . Our portfolio of standard solutions includes: ● Our standard single-zone FSR ® sensors are the most versatile force-sensing technology on the market today. These innovative sensors provide an inverse change in resistance in response to an increase or decrease in applied force. These provide engineers and designers with a durable, reliable, easy to measure, easy to integrate, thin-form factor and low-cost solution for HMI touch solutions and analog data capture for machines. FSR ® sensors are available in a range of sizes, shapes and lengths and with several connection options. We also now offer them in different force-sensing ranges, with the introduction of our FSR X ® and FSR UX ® range of standard sensors. These new sensors were developed in our material science development lab. ● Force-sensing linear potentiometers (“FSLP”) are sensors which can be used for menu navigation and control. Our use of force allows for high-rate scrolling and a more intuitive user experience. The FSLP is an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra-low-power based solution that brings intuitive user controls to reduced form factor hand-held consumer electronic devices. These sensors are available in multiple lengths. We also offer a ring sensor for full 360-degree position sensing. All of our FSLP sensors are designed to be integrated into a device’s host processor without the need for a dedicated microprocessor. ● Our integrated mouse modules and pointing solutions can add touchpad or 360-degree pointing control to virtually any electronic device. Ranging from simple mouse button integration to NEMA-rated (National Electrical Manufacturer Association) industrial pointing devices, these solutions are ideal for applications away from the desktop. The modules use FSR ® technology and measurement firmware in a four-zone sensor or 4-wire resistive touchpad configuration along with a micro-controller to provide pressure sensitive cursor direction and speed control in a durable and easy to integrate form factor. ● After initial product development activity in the area of piezoelectric film sensors consisting of a highly successful custom implementation in automotive applications, we now have a set of standard piezo sensors as well as a development kit available for our customers to evaluate and test the capabilities and potential of this sensor solution.

        "text": "Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Our Company Interlink Electronics, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Interlink” or the “Company”) is a global sensor and printed electronics company operating in two principal sensor technology divisions: force/touch sensors, and gas and environmental sensors. Our force/touch sensors, including our Force-Sensing Resistor (“FSR ® ”) technology and related technologies, and our membrane keypads, graphic overlays and printed electronics, are used extensively in Human-Machine Interface (“HMI”) devices. Our gas and environmental sensors and instruments are used in environmental and air quality monitoring across a broad range of applications. Force/Touch Sensors . We design, develop, manufacture and sell a range of force-sensing technologies that incorporate our proprietary materials technology, firmware and software into a portfolio of standard products and custom solutions. These include sensor components, subassemblies, modules and products that support effective, efficient cursor control and novel three-dimensional user inputs. Our HMI technology platforms are deployed in a wide range of markets, including consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and medical. The application of our HMI technology platforms includes vehicle entry, vehicle multi-media control interface, rugged touch controls, presence detection, collision detection, speed and torque controls, pressure mapping, biological monitoring and others. Additionally, through our acquisition of Calman Technology Limited in March 2023, we offer customized membrane keypads, graphic overlays, printed electronics and industrial label products for use in a wide range of fields, from industrial instrumentation, process control and monitoring to medical and diagnostic devices and defense systems. With over 25 years as a leading HMI provider, Calman Technology has developed to also become a specialized provider of printed electronics for the medical sector in the UK and Europe. Interlink has been a leader in the printed electronics industry for nearly 40 years with the commercialization of our patented FSR ® technology that has enabled rugged and reliable HMI solutions. Our applications and solutions have focused on handheld user input, menu navigation, cursor control, and other intuitive interface technologies for the world’s top electronics manufacturers. We invented FSR ® technology and pioneered commercialization of printed electronics manufacturing, paving the way for industry-wide adoption of force-sensing technology. Our extensive knowledge and experience with this technology, along with the firmware we incorporate in our HMI solutions, differentiates us from other providers of HMI solutions. We, along with our customers, incorporate our FSR ® and force-sensing sensors and modules into end-user products. Our sensors and modules are used in electronics devices and systems where user input must be converted into useful output data. Our force-sensing technology solution platforms enable industry-first implementations in gaming, smartphone, rugged notebook, automotive cockpit and automotive entry applications. Consumer and end-user demand for enhanced user experience is driving the need for innovative multi-modal HMI technologies and applications. Force-sensing input provides a critical novel modality that drives a paradigm shift in HMI. The market is increasingly requiring innovative solutions that enable smaller, thinner devices, lower power consumption, highly refined designs, better navigation and more intuitive usability in all environments, and the need for these solutions is driving increased demand for our products. High-tech products are moving towards the use of multi-modal HMI in the home, industrial, medical and automotive spaces. Interlink delivers cutting-edge, high-performance HMI solutions for customers who wish to replace outdated switches and knobs in these environments. Significant market opportunities are rapidly emerging for us to improve upon the functionality of standard capacitive sensors which are widely available and competitively priced. Inadvertent activation, where users unintentionally activate a control, is a common problem with capacitive technology. In contrast, force-sensing solutions require a deliberate application of force to operate. We have had success in using our force-sensing solutions in combination with capacitive technologies to minimize the latter’s performance issues, enabling force-sensing solutions to complement competitive technologies and provide hybrid solutions and open up new opportunities for growth. At the same time, we continue to expand our standard product portfolio and develop new technology platforms to grow existing markets and capture emerging markets. We have recently added a range of standard piezoelectric sensor products which are used as dynamic strain gauges and vibration sensors. These sensors are thin, flexible and light-weight while also being extremely rugged and durable. We possess deep domain knowledge about how to integrate these into custom applications and have developed machine learning and artificial intelligence to make information-rich data available to our customers for their unique and innovative applications.

(“we”, “us”, “our”, “Interlink” or the “Company”) is a global sensor and printed electronics company operating in two principal sensor technology divisions: force/touch sensors, and gas and environmental sensors. Our force/touch sensors, including our Force-Sensing Resistor (“FSR ® ”) technology and related technologies, and our membrane keypads, graphic overlays and printed electronics, are used extensively in Human-Machine Interface (“HMI”) devices. Our gas and environmental sensors and instruments are used in environmental and air quality monitoring across a broad range of applications. Force/Touch Sensors . We design, develop, manufacture and sell a range of force-sensing technologies that incorporate our proprietary materials technology, firmware and software into a portfolio of standard products and custom solutions. These include sensor components, subassemblies, modules and products that support effective, efficient cursor control and novel three-dimensional user inputs. Our HMI technology platforms are deployed in a wide range of markets, including consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and medical. The application of our HMI technology platforms includes vehicle entry, vehicle multi-media control interface, rugged touch controls, presence detection, collision detection, speed and torque controls, pressure mapping, biological monitoring and others. Additionally, through our acquisition of Calman Technology Limited in March 2023, we offer customized membrane keypads, graphic overlays, printed electronics and industrial label products for use in a wide range of fields, from industrial instrumentation, process control and monitoring to medical and diagnostic devices and defense systems. With over 25 years as a leading HMI provider, Calman Technology has developed to also become a specialized provider of printed electronics for the medical sector in the UK and Europe. Interlink has been a leader in the printed electronics industry for nearly 40 years with the commercialization of our patented FSR ® technology that has enabled rugged and reliable HMI solutions. Our applications and solutions have focused on handheld user input, menu navigation, cursor control, and other intuitive interface technologies for the world’s top electronics manufacturers. We invented FSR ® technology and pioneered commercialization of printed electronics manufacturing, paving the way for industry-wide adoption of force-sensing technology. Our extensive knowledge and experience with this technology, along with the firmware we incorporate in our HMI solutions, differentiates us from other providers of HMI solutions. We, along with our customers, incorporate our FSR ® and force-sensing sensors and modules into end-user products. Our sensors and modules are used in electronics devices and systems where user input must be converted into useful output data. Our force-sensing technology solution platforms enable industry-first implementations in gaming, smartphone, rugged notebook, automotive cockpit and automotive entry applications. Consumer and end-user demand for enhanced user experience is driving the need for innovative multi-modal HMI technologies and applications. Force-sensing input provides a critical novel modality that drives a paradigm shift in HMI. The market is increasingly requiring innovative solutions that enable smaller, thinner devices, lower power consumption, highly refined designs, better navigation and more intuitive usability in all environments, and the need for these solutions is driving increased demand for our products. High-tech products are moving towards the use of multi-modal HMI in the home, industrial, medical and automotive spaces. Interlink delivers cutting-edge, high-performance HMI solutions for customers who wish to replace outdated switches and knobs in these environments. Significant market opportunities are rapidly emerging for us to improve upon the functionality of standard capacitive sensors which are widely available and competitively priced. Inadvertent activation, where users unintentionally activate a control, is a common problem with capacitive technology. In contrast, force-sensing solutions require a deliberate application of force to operate. We have had success in using our force-sensing solutions in combination with capacitive technologies to minimize the latter’s performance issues, enabling force-sensing solutions to complement competitive technologies and provide hybrid solutions and open up new opportunities for growth. At the same time, we continue to expand our standard product portfolio and develop new technology platforms to grow existing markets and capture emerging markets. We have recently added a range of standard piezoelectric sensor products which are used as dynamic strain gauges and vibration sensors. These sensors are thin, flexible and light-weight while also being extremely rugged and durable. We possess deep domain knowledge about how to integrate these into custom applications and have developed machine learning and artificial intelligence to make information-rich data available to our customers for their unique and innovative applications.

Interlink benefits from its own world-class manufacturing facilities in Shenzhen, China, and Irvine, Scotland, and its advanced and proprietary gas and environmental sensors production and development facility in Silicon Valley, allowing us to react quickly to customer needs while ensuring the highest quality standards. We also maintain a technical sales force that can address new and existing customer opportunities worldwide. Our teams engage early in the development phase with our customers and we provide critical design inputs to ensure the solutions developed address the customer’s needs and meet their design goals and intent. We strive to solve our customers’ problems. Our Technology Platforms and Products Force/Touch Sensing Technology and HMI . Interlink was founded on the invention and commercialization of FSR ® technology, the industry’s first force-sensing solution using printed electronics manufacturing. As we transition from an FSR ® sensor supplier to an HMI solutions provider, we are pursuing and embracing leading edge force-sensing and related technology platforms. Our materials science and engineering team in Camarillo, California, led by our VP of Engineering & Advanced Materials, and our embedded software engineering team located in Singapore, are focused on strategic technology roadmaps, development of scalable technology platform architectures and pursuit of synergistic technology partnerships. In an ever-changing and competitive landscape, we are committed to staying ahead of the technology curve. The two primary types of user-input technologies common in today’s devices are capacitive and resistive. Capacitive sensors are used in the touch screens found in most smartphones and similar devices used globally by millions of consumers. The most significant drawback to the capacitive technology is its inability to measure force, although there has been some progress recently in enhancing technology designed to mimic force-sensing. Capacitive sensors have become a high-volume, low-margin commodity product. Our patented FSR ® sensor technology consists of a bottom layer of conductor electrodes, a proprietary resistive material top layer and a separator between the two layers. An additional top layer that contains graphics and protects the sensor can also be added. FSR ® sensors can be as thin as eight thousandths of an inch, making them particularly well suited for use where the design space is restricted, as in portable or wearable electronics. Our force-sensing technology enables the sensor to be used for continuously variable control functions. For example, in a pointing device, increased pressure can be used to produce faster cursor movement. Unlike capacitive devices, an FSR ® sensor’s performance is not impeded by the presence of moisture, dirt or dust, making the sensor suitable for use outdoors and in moist and other “hostile” environments. Our FSR ® sensors have no moving parts, can be packaged in a sealed environment, and are lower power and less susceptible to false readings or unintended touches than capacitive sensors. Thanks to our optimized manufacturing processes developed over many years, we can produce easily customized, high-margin solutions for our customers. Our piezoelectric sensors consist of an electroactive polymer which generates an electric charge when a mechanical stress or strain is applied. This polymer film can be as thin as 30 micrometers (less than half the thickness of a human hair). The electric charge generated can be accumulated, collected and used with specially printed electrodes on the surface of the thin film. The resulting transducers can be used as dynamic strain, vibration and force sensors. The sensors are unique in that they can also be operated in reverse whereby applying an electrical charge to the sensor can cause it to bend or deform. This deformation can be used to create polymeric actuators for haptic applications. Finally, these sensors can also generate an electrical charge when exposed to a temperature change. This effect is known as a pyroelectric effect. This characteristic can be used to create passive infra-red motion sensors where the emitted heat of a body in proximity to the sensor causes a change in temperature on the sensor surface and the resulting charge can be transduced and correlated to a motion event. These properties enable us to create thin, light-weight, and flexible dynamic strain gauges and vibration sensors. These sensors have a very broad frequency band and are suitable for many applications. They are extremely rugged and can be used for high impact force-sensing applications, and can also be implemented on large areas and curved surfaces. In addition, they have high voltage sensitivity and simple interface electronics. These transducers produce an information-rich signal, and it requires deep domain knowledge to successfully integrate these sensors. We have developed sophisticated algorithms and firmware that allows our FSR ® and piezo sensor technology to become a complete solution delivering effective HMI functionality to our customers. We are now also using machine learning and artificial intelligence to further enhance the user experience and provide compelling solutions for our customers. The acquisition of Calman Technology has given us a manufacturing capability close to the UK and European markets, providing custom solutions in a broad range of sectors, including the medical and diagnostic sensor marketplace.
